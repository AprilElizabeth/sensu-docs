Request Submissionsissueandpullrequestsubmissions Gem Metadatagemmetadata Additional Informationadditionalinformation Naming Conventions All binaries should start with either handler check metrics or mutator depending on their primary function This is done to ensure that a user can tell from the command what the primary action of the script is It also makes things easier for infrastructure tools The names of scripts should use dashes to separate words and contain an extension rb sh exe etc Extensions are unfortunately necessary for Sensu to be able to directly exec plugins and handlers on Windows All scripts should also be made executable using chmod x plugin or a similar method There is a rake task that is run by Travis that will automatically make all files in bin executable if this is not done Any repos created need to follow the format of sensupluginsapp where app is the name such as windows diskchecks or influxdb The exception to the rule are repos used for the site or tooling such as GIR or sensupluginsgithubio This is done so that the rake tasks and other automation tools can easily parse Github and effectively work with the 150 repos Coding Style When developing plugins please use the sensu plugin class1 this ensures all plugins have an identical run structure When using options please use the following structure At the very least the option needs to include a description to assist the user with configuration and deployment option port short p PORT long port PORT description Port Each script should use the following standard header usrbinenv ruby DESCRIPTION OUTPUT plain text metric data etc PLATFORMS Linux Windows BSD Solaris etc DEPENDENCIES gem sensuplugin USAGE NOTES LICENSE Released under the same terms as Sensu the MIT license see LICENSE for details When at all possible preference is given to pure Ruby implementations There should only be system or platform dependencies in the specific gems that use them such as sensupluginswindows Copyright and Licensing The preferred license for all code associated with the project is the MIT License15 other compatible licenses can certainly be looked at by the community as whole Any code that is written is owned by the developer and as such the copyright if they desire should be set to themselves This is an open source project and built upon the collective code of all who contribute no one person or entity owns everything If for whatever reason they wish to not assign copyright to themselves then it can be assigned to sensuplugins Documentation All documentation will be handled by Yard2 using the default markup at this time A brief introduction to Yard markup can be found here3 All scripts should have as much documentation coverage as possible ideally 100 Coverage can be tested by installing Yard locally and running rake yard Changelog The change log should follow the format listed here20 Please keep this changelog up to date if you make changes to the repo and submit a PR please update the changelog accordingly Please follow the guidelines below when updating the changelog with respect to which number to bump Dependency Management Dependencies ruby gems packages etc and other requirements should be declared in the header of the plugin and more importantly in the gemspec Try to use the standard library or the same dependencies as other plugins to keep the stack as small as possible Questions about using a specific gem feel can be opened as issues on Github or feel free to ask the mailing list Issue and Pull Request Submissions If you see something wrong or come across a bug please open up an issue try to include as much data in the issue as possible If you feel the issue is critical than tag a team member and we will respond as soon as is feasible Pull requests need to follow the guidelines below for the quickest possible merge These not only make our lives easier but also keep the repo and commit history as clean as possible Please do a git pull rebase both before you start working on the repo and then before you commit This will help ensure the most up to date codebase Rubocop rules and documentation is available It will also go along way towards cutting down or eliminatinghopefully annoying merge commits The CHANGELOG follows the standard conventions laid out here20 Every PR has to include an updated CHANGELOG and README if needed this makes our lives eaiser increases the accuracy of the codebase and gets your PR deployed much faster When updating the version in the changelog please keep the following in mind the patch version is for any nonbreaking changes to existing scripts or the addition of minor functionality to existing scripts the minor version is for the addition of any new scripts Even though this is generally nonbreaking it is a major change to the gem and should be indicitated as such the major version should only be bumped by a core contributor This is for major breaking or nonbreaking changes that affect widespreadspread functionality Examples of this would be a wholesale refactor of the repo or a switch away from an established method such as going from SOAP to REST across multiple checks All new scripts modules or classes must be fully tested There are well documented examples in the pagerduty21 plugin Tracking the status of your PR or issue or seeing all open tickets in the org regardless of repo is simple using Github filters16 To get started click on the Github logo in the upper left and select either Pull Requests or Issues In the search box you will see several terms predefined for you change authorname to usersensuplugins to see across the entire org Please do not not abandon your pull request only you can help us merge it We will wait for feedback from you on your pull request for up to sixty days A lack of feedback in after this may require you to reopen your pull request If you would like to make a pull request and the repo does not already exist then please feel free to directly contact a member of the team using our public email address or open an issue in the Feature Request19 repo and we will create a repo for you As a general rule if you ask to have a repo created you will also be given write access to it by default Gem Metadata Each gem has metadata that can easily be queried and is designed to allow a user or contributor to get a good quick read on the current status of the gem and how stable it is This functions much like the Milestone idea that Logstash plugins are built around thanks goes out to hatt for suggesting this smetadata maintainer The maintainer field can be anyone feel free to reach out to the team about adding your github handle to the gem and assuming ownership of it Many of these plugins require specialized knowledge and by their very nature many people depend upon them to be high quality smetadata developmentstatus The developmentstatus filed allows users know the development state of a plugin active active development is on going by a developer or maintainer maintenance no active refactoring or development but someone is watching out for any new prs or things to do unmaintained the community as a whole is keeping an eye on this but no one has staked a claim to it most plugins will end up here smetadata productionstatus The productionstatus field gives a quick glance on whether the gem should be used for production grade monitoring or if some review and care should be taken production grade near 100 rspec and yardoc coverage stable review recommended incomplete rspec and

repos This was done to simplify the deployment and delivery process When working with a repo as diverse as the communityplugins its very hard to version and deploy it in the methods that we all would like Splitting the repo into smaller pieces makes this much easier and more manageable in the long run Why are the repos named this way The repos are named based up the application product or function they are associated with This means that if you use apache you need only install the sensupluginsapache gem or clone the repo When it comes to handlers and mutators the same convention was used so that in the future if a check is added the repo name wont change Sensupluginspagerduty is a great example it may only contain handlers at this time but if in the future we want to add a check of an endpoint we dont need to do anything more than bump the version and update the docs Besides having a standard naming convention makes automation and deployment tools very happy and we all use them right How do I know what a repo contains One of the conditions for dropping the prerelease or alpha tag will be a complete README that will include a list of all binaries and what each one does sensupluginsdiskchecks1 does this now Why did you change the filenames and why name them this way One of the overriding issues is that there should be a standard naming scheme for the entire framework It is very hard to effectively automate something if the pieces are scattered or named differently As of now the current names are here to stay What about tests how do I know a plugin works as designed Tests are coming that is one of the core requirements for stability and production grade Tests are hard to write for some of these things given the very specific nature of them and most of us have other jobs so we can only contribute so much How do I use this handler deploy this check The readme will contain sample configs and commands Many of the plugins also have a header that contains specific details If this is lacking ask in Slackhttpsslacksensuio or on the mailing listhttpsgroupsgooglecomforumforumsensuusers and someone will be able to assist you Will the communityplugins repo be deleted and if so when No It will be frozen in place at a date TBD most likely sometime Fall 2015 although that is a moving target and dependent upon a lot of things How should I deploy the new plugins If a gem exists then that would be the best way Instructions for installing it can be found in the README of the repo or here3 If no gem exists yet then you can attempt to build one based upon the gemspec You can also install straight from source All repos have releases you can just download the latest tarball or zip file cloning the master branch is not recommended supported and never will be Unless its a breaking change the repo will not contain feature branches everything will be pushed to master You have been warned Checks are invasive how do I know they havent been tampered with All gems will be signed and each repo will contain the public key If you are really concerned you could just inspect the code yourself as well before deployment Will you be targeting other pkg management systems Not at this time due to the design of Sensu gems are the best choice RPMs and Deb packages have not been ruled out but the manpower to create them is just not there at this time If you have a very strong interest in this drop us a line and we can chat some more Are the gems dependent upon Rubygems No What is the policy on supporting endoflifeEOL Ruby versions We will target all non EOL Ruby versions please check the link below the see the current EOL version httpswwwrubylangorgendownloadsbranches What versions or Ruby do you test against We strive to test on all nonEOL versions It

set of production grade gems from the Sensu Community Plugins2 is a huge task that will take considerable time only with the continued effort of many people can this goal can be achieved The original community plugins repo has already been split in smaller repos3 based upon application This means all the Windows plugins handlers etc are in a repo named sensupluginswindows the aws ones are in sensupluginsaws and so on This is only the first step towards completing the transformation existing tooling will need to be improved and new tooling created for managing all the repos separately but also as a whole A maintainer should be able to issue a single command and have a template generated and installed in all repos manually copying a file to every repo is so 2006 D Task General refactoring of community plugins code base Brief explanation All the binaries in a repository should be broken down into libraries and any common code should be shared All new code should be written in Ruby and when possible existing code in other languages should be converted or its functionality should be folded into other code Expected Results Minimal code duplication Standard4 Ruby coding practices Ephemeral data whenever needed no traces left on a monitored system including temp files used to store state data Favor a pure ruby method over a arch specific method even at the sacrifice of code complexity ie sysfilesystem gem vs df Note Not every repository needs to be complete a list of high priority repos or ones of particular interest will be mutually determined Why Work On This

Jones5 or Artem Chernikov6 Proposal Guidelines When submitting your proposal please pick one or more repos and explain why you want to work with them and any domain specific knowledge or skills you have to help you complete the task Task Automated testing framework built around Travis using standard Ruby methods practices and tools Brief explanation In order to be considered production grade test coverage needs to be fairly high and not everyone has the time or ability to write tests A framework should be designed and built to automate the process of writing and executing tests There is a fair amount of latitude in how this is accomplished as minimal work has been done on this A good starting point would be the sensupluginsspec7 repo Expected Results We expect to have the foundation for a set of tools written in Ruby which will Improve the existing set of development tools including GIR1 which is currently able to bootstrap a plugin development environment including gem and repo creation Create an automated testing framework which will allow us to run a set of tests within virtual machines and report back the status of that process Why Work On This This would be a great project for someone who wants to improve their Ruby skills and learn more about tool writing and writing automated test suites This is a ground up project so you would have the ability to contribute in a major way including helping to select the test packages and work on the design of the tooling to help facilitate its use Knowledge prerequisite general understanding of various testing tools such

Chernikov6 Proposal Guidelines When submitting your proposal please explain your views on testing code and infrastructure along with specific knowledge or skills you have to help you complete the task A brief summary of your choice of tools and why you pick them should also be included Task A simple comprehensive directory of all monitors handlers and tools Brief explanation With the split of the community repo in 150 separate repos users may have a hard time finding a particular monitor or know that a monitor or handler for a service already exists There should be a directory we can point them to that will offer this functionality in a clean manner The directory should be updated automatically upon the release of a new gem github tag or repo Consideration will need to be given for the ratelimiting that is inherent with Github Expected Results We would like a solid design and poc of the code and tools necessary to build and maintain the directory It need not be complete but substantial progress should have been made and it should be in a poc state with complete functionality Current technologies in consideration are Nodejs RoR vanilla js Why Work On This Not much has been done on this front yet so the student would in effect have free rein with the design as long as it meets the functional requirements and the code is clean modular and stable This would include

setup and configure basic monitoring for their system Brief explanation With the split of the community repo in 150 separate repos users may have a hard time finding a particular monitor or know that a monitor or handler for a service already exists It would be nice for a user to be able to query a db and get back a list of gems to install to monitor their system For example a user wants to setup baseline monitoring but has no idea what to install for gems They would type in baseline and get back a list of packages whose metadata matches baseline Expected Results We would like a solid design

web experience is not critical but would very be helpful Task Expand monitors for a given product platform or api Brief explanation There are still lots of apis platforms and tools out there that have minimal or nonexistent monitoring The student with the guidance of the mentor can pick one or several of these to write monitors and handlers or gather metrics for At the outset a proper scope dependent upon the chosen type of monitoring to be implemented would be agreed upon by both the student and the mentor A partial list of topics include expanded monitoring of elasticsearch or other large scale data stores improvements upon existing monitoring for Windows Server and Windows applications platform specific monitors for BSD VMS etc monitors and integration with various hypervisors such as KVM QEMU or ESXi low level monitoring of the linux kernel using kernel probes monitoring of various environmental metrics found in a datacenter including battery performance chasis temperature and network latency monitoring of various scada fpga or other embedded systems Expected Results A set of completed stable and production grade monitors handlers etc that are within the scope agreed upon by the student and the mentor at the outset The emphsis will be on quality not quanity and all code will be written in Ruby following the Developer Guidelines8 for the sensu plugins Why Work On This Freedom to explore Pick a topic and figure out how it works is commonly used and fails then effectively code ways to detect or possibly correct these failures A well defined scope will be created with the student to prevent chasing edge cases feature creep and black holes You will get a feel for how infrastructure developers and system administrators tackle a monitoring problem and how an effective monitor is written from design to code through to testing and production use You will get a chance to own the problem and create a solution based upon your personal preferences while

services and application health or collect analyze metrics Sensu handlers2 ie to send notifications or perform other actions based on Sensu events3 or Sensu mutators3 ie to modify event data4 prior to handling The Sensu Plugin specification Sensu Plugins provide executable scripts or other programs that can be used as a Sensu check command5 pipe handler command6 or mutator command7 Sensu plugins must comply with a simple specification Accept inputdata via STDIN handler and mutator plugins only Optionally able to parse a JSON data payload ie event data4 Output data to STDOUT or STDERR Produce an exit status code to indicate state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an unknown or custom status Optionally able to parse command line arguments to modify plugin behavior PRO TIP Those familiar with the Nagios14 monitoring system may recognize this specification as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins As a result Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu15 without any modification Where to find Sensu Plugins The Sensu Plugins project The Sensu Plugins project8 is a communitypowered open source software project9 that is organized by members of the Sensu community in collaboration with the Sensu development team The Sensu Plugins project currently maintains hundreds of plugins providing various checks handlers and mutators which are used by thousands of organizations around the world Most of the plugins maintained by the Sensu Plugins project are Rubybased plugins which are distributed via Rubygemsorg10 and installable via sensuinstall11 Featured Sensu Plugins To help new users discover some of the most popular plugins for instrumenting their infrastructure and integrating Sensu with popular tools and services a featured plugins page12 is provided on the Sensu website These featured plugins are the same plugins developed and maintained by the Sensu plugins project13 Nagios plugins and the Nagios Exchange As previously mentioned the Sensu Plugin specification16 is 100 compatible with the Nagios plugin specification17 as a result Nagios plugins may be used with Sensu without any modification Sensu allows you to bring new life to the 50 plugins in the official Nagios Plugins project18 which began life in 199919 making it a very mature source for monitoring plugins and over 4000 plugins available in the Nagios Exchange20 Write your own custom plugins With a simple specification16 which makes it possible to write Sensu plugins in almost any programming language21 its very easy to write your own custom plugins for Sensu Example plugins The following example demonstrates how to write a very basic Sensu Plugin in the Ruby programming language usrbinenv ruby A simple example handler plugin require json Read the incoming JSON data from STDIN event JSONparseSTDINread symbolizenames true Create an output object using Ruby string interpolation output The check named eventcheckname generated the following output eventoutput Convert the mutated event data back to JSON and output it to STDOUT puts output NOTE this example doesnt provide much in terms of functionality it would simply be logged to the Sensu server23 log file but it does provide a starting point for a simple custom plugin Plugin execution How and where are plugins executed As mentioned elsewhere in the documentation see check commands5 pipe handler commands6 and mutator commands7 all plugins are executed by a Sensu client24 or Sensu server23 as the sensu user Plugins must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu system ie installed in a system PATH directory or they must be referenced with an absolute path eg optpathtomyplugin NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commandseg command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg What programming languages are supported Any programming language that can satisfy the Sensu plugin specification16 requirements ndash which is nearly any programming language in the world ndash can be used to write Sensu plugins One of the primary advantages of writing Sensu plugins in the Ruby programming language is that Sensu itself is written in Ruby and all Sensu installer packages provide an embedded Ruby25 eliminating the need to install or depend on a separate runtime NOTE plugins written in programming languages other than Ruby will require the corresponding runtime to be installed in order for the plugin to run What is Sensus EMBEDDEDRUBY All Sensu Core installer packages provide an embedded Ruby runtime ie even if a system Ruby is installed Sensu will run on its own Ruby This vendored Ruby runtime can be accessed by Rubybased plugins by setting Sensus EMBEDDEDRUBY configuration variable26 to true NOTE in Sensu versions 0210 all initservice scripts provided by the Sensu Core installer packages are setting Sensus EMBEDDEDRUBY environment

sensuplugin gem Although Sensu Plugins may be written in any programming language21 there are certain advantages of writing plugins in Ruby From an operations perspective Rubybased plugins are convenient because they are able to run on Sensus embedded Ruby25 Rubybased plugins also benefit from the sensuplugin gem27 mdash a Ruby library that provides some builtin functionality and a number of helper classes and that simplify custom plugin development Much of the builtin functionality provided by the sensuplugin gem depends on custom client check andor handler definition attributes as documented below Plugin configuration Example check plugin definition The following is an example Sensu check definition29 that uses the checkhttprb script provided by the Sensu HTTP Plugin22 and a custom check definition attribute28 called refresh Although the refresh attribute itself is not directly supported by Sensu the sensuplugin gem does provide builtin support for reducing alert fatigue via the SensuPluginHandler class ie only handling events on the first occurrence and again every N occurrences where N refresh checks apihealth command checkhttprb u httpsapiexamplecomhealth standalone true interval 60 refresh 60 Sensu plugin definition specification NOTE plugins based on the sensuplugin gem derive configuration from custom check definition attributes28 The configuration examples provided above and the specification provided here are for clarification and convenience only ie this specification is just an extension of the check definition specification29 and not a definition of a distinct Sensu primitive Check definition attributes occurrences "},{"title":"Release

sensuplugins Not just in terms of code but in terms of community involvement and scope Some of these are fairly far off some are nearing completion Community Involvement Umbrella Org Sensu itself is a framework and the plugins are just one piece of it Many of the companies that use Sensu have created custom workflows checks and handlers then open sourced them These could solve another users problem but if the user doesnt know about them it wont do them any good The thought here is to have a central location where other companies and individuals can list their code for all to use There would be few conditions surrounding this and it will give people a chance to see how others have implemented or modified existing solutions These companies wouldnt have to go through the PR process as they would be considered unoffical externally maintained projects and they would retain full control of the code yet be able to share it and get greater feedback There are are lot of things to still work out and think about but its on the table Planned Features Arch Independent Code One of the big pushes will be for arch independent code A short coming of other major monitoring solutions is the lack of real platform independence This is a high priority and is something that is always in consideration Many of the disk and process checks have already been refactored to achieve this and more are in progress There will always be platform dependent checks such as linux kernel monitors or Windows event monitors but the more the number of these that can be reduced the better Wider Platform Testing Due to constraints with Travis we are only able to run automated tests against OSX109 and Ubuntu LTS We are working on a workflow that will allow use to run automated tests against multiple OSs and platforms including OSX108 OSX109 OSX1010 FreeBSD latest LTS and N1 Ubuntu latest LTS and N1 RHELCentOs 5x RHELCentOs 6x RHELCentOs 7x Debian latest stable and N1 Suse latest stable and N1 Solaris maybe Windows 2k8 Windows 2k12 Due to the scope of this and the resources necessary it will be a long time coming but talks around this are slowly becoming action Official BSD Support Ruby is just ruby is should not matter the platform With that being said support for sensuplugins on FreeBSD92 and 101 is coming shortly Several of the repo have Vagrantboxes for these platforms so one could test functionality on their own before installing the gem in their environment Website Plugin Directory With the split of the community repo in 150 separate repos users may have a hard time finding a particular monitor or know that a monitor or handler for a service already exists There should be a directory we can point them to that will offer this functionality in a clean manner The directory should be updated automatically upon the release of a new gem github tag or repo Consideration will need to be given for the ratelimiting that is inherent with Github There is still a lot of talk going on around this but Travis GH hooks and sinatra and fairly high on the tool list Configuration Mgmt Tool With the split of the community repo in 150 separate repos users may have a hard time finding a particular monitor or know that a monitor or handler for a service already exists It would be nice for a user to be able to query a db and get back a list of gems to install to monitor their system For example a user wants to setup baseline monitoring but has no idea what to install for gems They would type in baseline and get back a list of packages whose metadata matches baseline There is still a lot of talk going on around this but Travis GH hooks and sinatra and fairly high on the tool list I mattyjones would love to use golang for this and the directory but that may be extreme overkill Note I personally mattjones hate gui configuration management tools and this almost falls in the realm of it but if done properly and effectively it could avoid becoming a beast of burden that needs to be put to sleep I leave it up to the community to figure out what they want I just know there has to be a better way Help Wanted Grab a repo and come play If you have another thought on something related then by all means reach out to someone on the team Until then much monitoringlove sensuplugins

endpointtheinfoapiendpoint info GETinfoget How to obtain API status information The Sensu API provides two distinct endpoints for obtaining API status information health and info The Health API provides status information about the health of the APIs connections to the Sensu data store1 and transport2 The Info API provides a report on the status of the API including API version the status of the APIs connections to the Sensu data store and transport and the number of messages and consumers in various transport queues The health API endpoint health GET The health API provides HTTP GET access to test or verify the health of the monitoring system The Health API is provided for monitoring Sensu mdash it facilitates service checks to ensure that a minimal number of Sensu servers3 are connected to the transport ie transport consumers andor to ensure that the transport queue isnt growing which would indicate that the Sensu servers arent able to keeping up with the volume of keepalive messages4 and check results5 being produced NOTE the health API obtains its information via the info API PRO TIP the Health API messages URL parameter6 eg healthmessages1000 can be used to monitor the number of messages queued on the Sensu transport2 and then leveraged by other automation tools to trigger an auto scaling or similar provisioning event to automatically add one or more Sensu servers to a Sensu installation EXAMPLE healthgetexample In the following example querying the health API with the consumers6 URL parameter will return an HTTP response code7 to indicate if the expected number of consumers ie Sensu servers3 are processing check results In this example we are expecting at least two 2 consumers to be running at all times ie at least two Sensu servers

query ie if you want to know if there are at least two Sensu servers processing check results a 412 response code would mean no WARNING transport consumers are a native concept in pubsub technology8 including actual message queues like RabbitMQ8 Because the Sensu transport library2 supports transports which are not actual message queues eg Redis10 some transports do not support the Health API consumers check because they dont support the concept of consumers ie this means that healthconsumers1 will always fail returning a 412 response code for Sensu installations using Redis as the

need support for Sensu please consider giving Sensu Enterprisehttpssensuapporggetstarted a try Do I need RabbitMQ to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq as a Transportreferencetransport Sensu services require access to a shared instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscription topics Does Redis need to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses Redisreferenceredis as a data store and the Sensu server services ie sensuserver sensuapi for Sensu Core sensuenterprise for Sensu Enterprise require access to the same Redis instance or cluster to store and access the Sensu client registry check results check execution history and current event data Do check definitions need to exist on every system I wish to monitor No Check definitions can be written as publishsubscribe pubsub or standalone Pubsub checks which specify a list of subscribers need only be configured on the Sensu server Standalone checks which are scheduled and executed by the Sensu client need only be configured on the clients where they should be run Where should check plugin executables be installed Regardless of where checks are defined the actual check executables need to exist on the filesystem for the Sensu client to execute them Check plugin executables can be installed in etcsensuplugins or optsensuembeddedbin the latter being the location where plugin executables are installed via sensuinstall What is a standalone check A standalone check is a check definition that is installed on and executed by the Sensu client without being scheduled by the Sensu server Standalone checks defer Check execution scheduling responsibilitiesoverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler to Sensu clients enabling decentralized management of monitoring checks and distribution of scheduling responsibilities Standalone checks may be used in conjunction with pubsub checks and are distinguished from pubsub checks by inclusion of the standalone true configuration parameter What happens if a single check is defined on both the Sensu server and client When a check request is published for a check defined on the Sensu server the Sensu client will look for a local definition matching the check name prior to executing the check If a local definition exists it is mergedreferenceconfigurationconfigurationmerging with the definition provided by the server with any local definition attributes overriding the definition provided by the Sensu server What is Sensu Client safemode In safemode a client will not run a check published by a Sensu server unless that check is also defined on the client Safe mode must be enabled on the Sensu Client via the safemode configuration attribute Can multiple Sensu servers be run concurrently in a cluster Yes Sensu is designed to be scaled horizontally ie by adding additional Sensu servers It supports fully automated leader election ensuring that a single Sensu server acts as a centralized Check Execution Scheduleroverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler automated failover automatically electing a new leader if the previous leader is unexpectedly unavailable and distributed event processing check results are distributed across all Sensu servers in a roundrobin fashion Running more than one Sensu server is highly recommended for performance and availability How are new systems registered Automatically Sensu clients register themselves when they start up The Sensu client process requires access to the Sensu Transportreferencetransport by default this is RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq see Sensu Configurationreferenceconfigurationtoplevelconfigurationscopes and some minimal client configuration eg a name address and one or more subscriptions in order to start When the Sensu client process starts it begins sending keepalives ndash a special type of check result containing client configuration data ndash which the Sensu server uses to know that a client is still connected When a client keepalive is received for a client name that is not currently registered with Sensu the client is added to the registry and a registration event is created automatically Do system clocks need to be synchronized Yes The Sensu services ie sensuclient sensuserver sensuapi sensuenterprise use the localsystem clock for generating timestamps When system clocks are out of sync between Sensu clients where data is collected and the Sensu server where data is processed Sensu may generate false positive client

for you The Sensu client software allows you to register a running instance of itself as capable of running any checks they might be eligible for Infrastructure sometimes includes hardware or services that dont necessarily support running the Sensu client software but still needs to be monitored For those cases proxy clientsproxyclients let you monitor anything you can tell Sensu about Adding a Sensu Client One of the first challenges new Sensu users often encounter is learning what is required to get a remote Sensu client1 to communicate with the Sensu server2 If youre in a hurry skip ahead to add a remote Sensu client3 for stepbystep instructions Alternatively once you understand the two requirements for adding Sensu clients youll know everything you need to start deploying Sensu clients to your entire infrastructure Please continue reading to learn how adding Sensu clients starts with configuration4 and is ultimately all about the transport5 It starts with configuration Sensu is designed to be operated via configuration This core philosophy is what enables Sensu to work so seamlessly with modern automation solutions and configuration management platforms To learn more about how Sensu is configured please consult the Sensu configuration reference documentation6 The Sensu client requires a minimal amount of configuration to enable it to automatically register itself7 with the Sensu server which configuration includes a client definition8 eg the client name address and subscriptions and a transport definition9 Its all about the transport The Sensu processes use a transport10 a message bus for communication By default this is RabbitMQ11 but modern versions of Sensu have added support for alternative transports12 including Redis13 Without a transport connection a Sensu client will be unable to send monitoring data eg keepalive messages14 check results15 etc In order to connect to the transport the Sensu client will need three pieces of information Which transport to use this tells Sensu which transport library should it load and which configuration scope should it use to obtain connection details A valid transport definition this provides Sensu with an IP address or hostname and any security credentials needed to connect to the transport Network access to the transport socket ie the Sensu client will need outbound network access and the transport will need to be configured to listen for remote network connections Add a remote Sensu client With the exception of Sensu clients that are running on the Sensu server which is very useful and strongly recommended all Sensu clients are essentially remote clients as they have to establish network communication to send monitoring data eg client keepalives14 and check results15 Please note the following steps that are required to add a remote Sensu client 1 Configure the client Create a client definition located at etcsensuconfdclientjson with the following contents replacing the values for the client name address and subscriptions with the corresponding values for the client you are adding client name i041256 address 8888 subscriptions default webserver 2 Tell the client which transport to use Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdtransportjson with the following contents replacing the value for the transport name with the corresponding value for the transport you are using eg use transport redis if you are using the Redis transport transport name rabbitmq reconnectonerror true 3 Tell the client how to connect to the transport Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson or etcsensuconfdredisjson if you are using the Redis transport NOTE please consult the corresponding reference documentation for RabbitMQ11 or Redis13 for more configuration examples and detailed information on how to configure Sensus connection 4 Start the client Start the Sensu client and verify connectivity by consulting the Sensu client log file NOTE The service command will not work on CentOS 5 the sysvinit script must be used eg sudo etcinitdsensuclient start sudo service sensuclient start Proxy Clients Sometimes a logical piece of infrastructure isnt a device we can run Sensu on Fundamentally Sensu gives you the flexibility to separate how checks run from where they run which lets you monitor arbitrary named black box devices or services For example you may have a router that you cant run Sensu on but publishes interesting information over SNMP that you want to gather metrics from Or maybe your monitor which other datacenters are visibleonline to you or have any number of creative use cases You can create a proxy client16 that can have attributes for use in check execution allowing you to use the client registry naturally for managed an unmanaged infrastructure See the reference for creating proxy clients16 or details on writing checks against them17 for more Troubleshooting 1 referenceclients 2 referenceserver 3

help Sensu users create monitoring checks At the conclusion of this guide you the user should have several Sensu checks in place to monitor and measure machine resources applications and services Each Sensu monitoring check in this guide demonstrates one or more check definition features for more information please refer to the Sensu checks reference documentation1 Objectives What will be covered in this guide Creation of standard checks functional tests Creation of metric collection checks server resources etc Creation of metric analysis checks querying time series data etc What are Sensu checks whataresensuchecks Sensu checks allow you to monitor server resources services and application health as well as collect analyze metrics they are executed on servers running the Sensu client Checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state The common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Create a standard check Standard Sensu checks are used to determine the health of server resources services and applications A standard check will query a resource for information to determine its state Once a standard check has determined the resource state it outputs a human readable message and exits with the appropriate exit status code to indicate its stateseverity OK WARNING etc Monitor the cron service The following instructions install the check dependencies and configure the Sensu check definition in order to monitor the Cron service Install dependencies checkcroninstalldependencies The checkprocessrb script provided by the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 can reliably detect if a service such as Cron is running or not The following instructions will install the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkprocessrb script sudo sensuinstall p processchecks006 Create the check definition for Cron The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcheckcronjson This check definition uses the checkprocessrb script installed above3 to determine if the Cron service is running The check is named cron and it runs checkprocessrb p cron on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 60 seconds interval NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron subscribers production interval 60 For a full listing of the checkprocessrb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbincheckprocessrb h Currently the Cron check definition requires that check requests be sent to Sensu clients with the production subscription This is known as pubsub check Optionally a check may use standalone mode which allows clients to schedule their own check executions The following is an example of the Cron check using standalone mode true The Cron check will now be executed every 60 seconds on each Sensu client with the check definition A Sensu check definition with standalone true does not need to specify subscribers checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 By default Sensu checks use the default Sensu event handler for events they create To specify a different Sensu event handler for a check use the handler attribute The debug event handler used in this example will log the Sensu event data to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 handler debug Using multiple handlers To specify multiple Sensu event handlers use the handlers attribute plural NOTE if both handler and handlers plural check definition attributes are used handlers will take precedence checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron

collection checks can output metric data in a variety of metric formats Graphite plaintext4 Nagios Performance Data5 OpenTSDB6 Metrics 20 wire format7 Measuring CPU utilization Install dependencies cpumetricsinstalldependencies The metricscpurb script provided by the Sensu CPU Checks Plugin8 collects and outputs CPU metrics in the Graphite plaintext format The following instructions will install the Sensu CPU Checks Plugin8 version 003 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the metricscpurb script sudo sensuinstall p cpuchecks003 Create the check definition for CPU metrics The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcpumetricsjson This check definition uses the metricscpurb script installed above9 to collect CPU metrics and output them in the Graphite plaintext format By default Sensu checks with an exit status code of 0 for OK do not create events unless they indicate a change in state from a nonzero status to a zero status ie resulting in a resolve action see Sensu Events10 Metric collection checks will output metric data regardless of the check exit status code however they usually exit 0 To ensure events are always created for a metric collection check the check type of metric is used The check is named cpumetrics and it runs metricscpurb on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 10 seconds interval The debug handler is used to log the graphite plaintext CPU metrics to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cpumetrics type metric command metricscpurb subscribers production interval 10 handler debug For a full listing of the metricscpurb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbinmetricscpurb h Create a metric analysis check A metric analysis check analyzes metric data which may or may not have been collected by a metrics collection check11 By querying external metric stores eg Graphite to perform data evaluations metric analysis checks allow you to perform powerful analytics based on trends in metric data rather than a single data point For example where monitoring and alerting on a single CPU utilization data point can result in false positive events based on momentary spikes monitoring and alerting on CPU utilization data over a specified period of time will improve alerting accuracy Because metric analysis checks require interaction with an external metric store providing a functional example is outside of the scope of this guide However assuming the existence of a Graphite installation that is populated with metric data the following example checks could be used The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 The check queries Graphite for a calculated moving average using the last 10 data points of the load balancer session count The session count moving average is compared with the provided alert thresholds A Sensu client running on the Graphite server would be responsible for scheduling and executing this check standalone mode NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks sessioncount command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t movingAveragelb1assetsbackendsessioncurrent10 w 100 c 200 standalone true interval 30 The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 for disk capacity metrics The Graphite API query uses highestCurrent to grab only the highest disk capacity metric to be compared with the provided alert thresholds This check will trigger an event alert when one or more disks on any machine are at the configured capacity threshold In this example configuration the check is configured to warn at 85 capacity w 85 and to raise a critical alert at 95 capacity c 95 checks diskcapacity command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t highestCurrentdiskcapacity1 w 85 c 95 a 120 standalone true interval 30 The following instructions will install the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkgraphitedatarb script sudo sensuinstall p graphite006 Checking on Other Clients proxyclients Sensu supports running checks where the results are considered to be for a client that isnt actually the one executing the check regardless of whether that client is a Sensu client or simply a proxy client14 There are a number of reasons for this use case but fundamentally Sensu handles it the same Checks are scheduled normally but by specifying a Proxy Request13 in your check clients that match certain definitions their clientattributes cause the check to run for each one The attributes supplied must normally match exactly as stated no variables or directives have any special meaning but you can still use eval to perform more complicated filtering with Ruby on the available value such as finding clients with particular subscriptions given that were dealing with

in this guide demonstrates one or more filter definition features for more information please refer to the Sensu filters reference documentation1 Objectives What will be covered in this guide Creation of an event filter Creation of an event filter with Ruby and math What are Sensu filters whataresensufilters Sensu filters allow you to filter out events destined for one or more event handlers Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keyvalues pairs with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter event recurrences to eliminate notification noise and to filter events that are not for production machines Create an event filter Inclusive filtering The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This filter definition will include events that match the filter criteria In this example the filter itself is named production which matches events with a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production Exclusive filtering To exclude events based on filter criteria set the negate filter definition attribute to true In this example the production filter will match events that do not have a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production negate true Using a filter To use the production filter for an event handler set the filter attribute in the handler definition For example handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filter production Using multiple filters To specify multiple Sensu event filters use the filters attribute plural NOTE if both filter and filters plural handler definition attributes are used filters will take precedence handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filters production operations Create an event filter with Ruby and math Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data counterparts via Ruby object comparison However it is also possible to use Ruby expressions to evaluate event data attribute values When a filter attribute value is a string that begins with eval the remainder of the string is evaluated as a Ruby expression The event data attribute value is provided to the Ruby expression as a variable entitled value If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match This Ruby expression evaluation is performed in a sandbox for safety The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterrecurrencesjson This filter excludes events that are not the first event occurrence and those that do not have an occurrence count divisible by 60 without a remainder recurrence Logically if checks with an execution interval of 1 minute are generating events every minute this filter will help reduce noise by only allowing event handling once per hour filters recurrences attributes occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 1 referencefilters"},{"title":"Intro to

are for taking action on events2 produced by check results such as sending an email alert creating or resolving a PagerDuty incident or storing metrics in Graphite There are several types of handlers pipe tcp udp transport and set Pipe handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the created process via STDIN TCP and UDP handlers send the event data to a remote socket Transport handlers publish the event data to the Sensu transport by default this is RabbitMQ Set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easier to manage many event handlers Create a pipe handler Pipe event handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the corresponding process via STDIN Install dependencies The following instructions install the eventfile Sensu handler plugin written in Ruby to etcsensupluginseventfilerb This handler plugin reads the event data via STDIN parses it creates a file name using the parsed event data and then writes the event data to the file eg

RESTful APIrestfulapi Architectural Diagram Sensu Architecture Gifimagessensudiagramgif Secure Transport Sensu services use a message bus eg RabbitMQ1 to communicate with one another technically speaking the Sensu services dont actually communicate with each other they only communicate with the message bus As of Sensu Core version 013 this message bus communication in Sensu has been abstracted as the Sensu Transport2 making it possible to leverage alternate transport solutions in place of RabbitMQ the default Transport Sensu services requires access to the same instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscriptions Data Store Sensu leverages a data store3 for data persistence Only the Sensu server API and dashboard services require access to the data store

automationndashfriendly eg it was designed to work with tools like Chef9 Puppet10 and Ansible11 Open source software with commercial support Sensu is an opensource software OSS project made freely available under a permissive MIT License12 the source code is publicly available on GitHub13 Sensu Enterprise14 is based on Sensu Core the OSS version of Sensu which makes addedvalue features commercial support training and many other benefits available under the Sensu License15 A Simple Yet Powerful Framework Sensu is a comprehensive monitoring solution that is powerful enough to solve complex monitoring problems at scale yet simple enough to use for traditional monitoring scenarios and small environments It achieves this broad appeal via building upon two simple yet powerful monitoring primitives Service Checks16 and Event Processing7 These building blocks also provide an infinitely extensible framework for composing monitoring solutions What is a Service Check servicechecks Service checks allow you to monitor services eg is Nginx running or measure resources eg how much disk space do I have left Service checks are executed on machines running a monitoring agent ie Sensu client17 Service checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state Common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Service checks produce results that are processed by the event processor ie the Sensu server Learn more 17 What is Event Processing eventprocessing Event processing also called stream processing is a method of analyzing processing and storing streams of information data about things that happen events deriving a conclusion from them and potentially executing some action handling The Sensu event processor the Sensu server enables you to execute Handlers18 for taking action on events produced by service checks such as sending an email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty or ServiceNow or storing metric data in a timeseries database eg Graphite Learn more 18 1 httpswwwpagerdutycom 2 httpsslackcom 3 httpwwwhipchatcom 4 referenceplugins 5 referenceenterprisebuiltinintegrations 6

client1 which monitor a condition eg is Nginx running or collect measurements eg how much disk space do I have left Although the Sensu client will attempt to execute any command defined for a check successful processing of check results requires adherence to a simple specification Sensu check specification Result data is output to STDOUT or STDERR2 For standard checks this output is typically a humanreadable message For metrics checks this output contains the measurements gathered by the check Exit status code indicates state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an UNKNOWN or custom status PRO TIP Those familiar with the Nagios3 monitoring system may recognize this specification as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins As a result Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu without any modification At every execution of a check command ndash regardless of success or failure ndash the Sensu client publishes the checks result4 for eventual handling by the event processor5 ie the Sensu server6 Check commands What is a check command Each Sensu check definition7 defines a command and the interval at which it should be executed Check commands are literally executable commands which will be executed on the Sensu client1 run as the sensu user Most check commands are provided by Sensu check plugins8 Check command arguments Sensu check command attributes may include command line arguments for controlling the behavior of the command executable Most Sensu check plugins8 provide support for command line arguments for reusability How and where are check commands executed As mentioned above all check commands are executed by Sensu clients1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu client system ie installed in a system PATH directory9 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg Check execution platform How are checks scheduled Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu serverserver and the Sensu client10 monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model11 ie subscription checkssubscriptionchecks The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks12 on the local system only Because Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive any Sensu client may be configured to both schedule and execute its own standalone checks as well as execute subscription checks scheduled by the Sensu server Subscription checks Sensu checks which are centrally defined and scheduled by the Sensu server6 are called subscription checks Sensus use of a message bus transport13 for communication enables topicbased communication14 mdash where messages are published to a specific topic and consumers subscribe to one or more specific topics This form of communication is commonly referred to as the publishsubscribe pattern11 or pubsub for short Subscription checks have a defined set of subscribers15 a list of transport13 topics14 that check requests will be published to Sensu clients become subscribers to these topics ie subscriptions via their individual client definition16 subscriptions attribute In practice subscriptions will typically correspond to a specific role andor responsibility eg a webserver database etc Subscriptions are a powerful primitives in the monitoring context because they allow you to effectively monitor for specific behaviors or characteristics corresponding to the function being provided by a particular system For example disk capacity thresholds might be more important or at least different on a database server as opposed to a webserver conversely CPU andor memory usage thresholds might be more important on a caching system than on a file server Subscriptions also allow you to configure check requests for an entire group or subgroup of systems rather than require a traditional 11 mapping Standalone checks Sensu checks which are defined on a Sensu client1 with the check definition attribute17 standalone set to true are called standalone checks The Sensu client provides its own scheduler10 for scheduling standalone checks which ensures scheduling consistency between Sensu clients with identical check definitions assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP18 Standalone checks are an important complement to subscription checks19 because they provide a decentralized management alternative for Sensu Check results What is a check result A check result is a JSON20 document published as a message on the Sensu transport13 by the Sensu client upon completion of a check execution Sensu check results include the check definition attributes17 eg command subscribers interval name etc including custom attributes21 the client name the result was submitted from and the output of the check Example check result output check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE please refer to the check result specification38 below for more information about check results Check token substitution What is check token substitution Sensu check definitions17 may include attributes that you may wish to override on a clientbyclient basis For example check commands23 ndash which may include command line arguments23 for controlling the behavior of the check command ndash may benefit from clientspecific thresholds etc Sensu check tokens are check definition placeholders that will be replaced by the Sensu client with the corresponding client definition attribute16 values including custom attributes24 NOTE Sensu check tokens were formerly known as check command tokens which limited token substitution to the check command attribute command tokens were also sometimes referred to as Sensu client overrides a reference to the fact that command tokens allowed client attributes to override check command arguments23 NOTE Check tokens are processed before check execution therefore token substitution will not apply to check data delivered via the local client socket input46 Example check tokens The following is an example Sensu check definition17 using three check tokens for check command arguments23 In this example the checkdiskusagerb command accepts w warning and c critical arguments to indicate the thresholds as percentages for creating warning or critical events As configured this check will create a warning event at 80 disk capacity unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskwarning80 and a critical event will be created if disk capacity reaches 90 unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskcritical90 This example also creates a custom check definition attribute called environment which will default to a value of production unless a different value is provided by the client definition ie environmentproduction checks checkdiskusage command checkdiskusagerb w diskwarning80 c diskcritical90 subscribers production interval 60 environment environmentproduction The following example Sensu client definition16 would provide the necessary attributes to override the diskwarning diskcritical and environment tokens declared above client name i424242 address 1002100 subscriptions production webserver mysql disk warning 75 critical 85 environment development Check token specification Token substitution syntax Check tokens are invoked by wrapping references to client attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters ie Nested Sensu client definition attributes16 can be accessed via dot notation eg diskwarning address would be replaced with the client address attribute26 url would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url diskwarning would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called warning nested inside of a JSON hash called disk Token substitution default values checktokendefaultvalues Check token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an attribute is not provided by the client definition16 Check token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for clients that are missing the declared token attribute urlhttpssensuapporg would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url If no such attribute called url is included in the client definition the default or fallback value of httpssensuapporg will be used Unmatched tokens If a token substitution default value25 is not provided ie as a fallback value and the Sensu client definition does not have a matching definition attribute a check result4 indicating unmatched tokens will be published for the check execution eg Unmatched check tokens diskwarning Check configuration Example check definition The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdchecksensuwebsitejson This check definition uses a Sensu plugin27 named checkhttprb28 to ensure that the Sensu website is still available The check is named sensuwebsite and it runs on Sensu clients with the production subscription15 at an interval of 60 seconds checks sensuwebsite command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers production interval 60 contact ops Check definition

attributescustomattributes What is a Sensu client Sensu clients are monitoring agents1 which are installed and run on every system eg server container etc that needs to be monitored The client is responsible for registering the system with Sensu sending client keepalive2 messages the Sensu heartbeat mechanism and executing monitoring checks Each client is a member of one or more subscriptions3 ndash a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc Sensu clients will subscribe to or watch for check requests4 published by the Sensu server5 via the Sensu Transport6 execute the corresponding requests locally and publish the results of the check back to the transport to be processed by a Sensu server Client keepalives What is a client keepalive Sensu Client keepalives are the heartbeat mechanism used by Sensu to ensure that all registered Sensu clients are still operational and able to reach the Sensu Transport6 Sensu clients publish keepalive messages containing client configuration data to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds If a Sensu client fails to send keepalive messages over a period of 120 seconds by default the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create a keepalive event7 Keepalives can be used to identify unhealthy systems and network partitions among other things and keepalive events can trigger email notifications and other useful actions Client registration the client registry registrationandregistry In practice client registrations happens when a Sensu server processes a client keepalive message for a client that is not already registered in the Sensu client registry based on the configured client name or source attribute This client registry is stored in the Sensu data store8 and is accessible via the Sensu Clients API9 All Sensu client data provided in client keepalive messages gets stored in the client registry which data is used to add context to Sensu Events7 and to detect Sensu clients in an unhealthy state Registration events If a Sensu event handler30 named registration is configured or if a Sensu client definition includes a registration attribute31 the Sensu server5 will create and process a Sensu event7 for the client registration applying any configured filters26 and mutators32 before executing the configured handlers30 Registration events are useful for executing onetime handlers for new Sensu clients For example registration event handlers can be used to update external Configuration Management Databases CMDBs34 such as ServiceNow35 etc To configure a registration event handler please refer to the Sensu event handler documentation30 for instructions on creating a handler named registration Alternatively please see Client definition registration attributes31 below WARNING registration events are not stored in the event registry in the Sensu data store8 so they are not accessible via the Sensu API however all registration events are logged in the Sensu server5 log Proxy clients Sensu proxy clients formerly known as Justintime or JIT clients are dynamically created clients added to the client registry if a client does not already exist for a check result Proxy client registration differs from keepalivebased registration because the registration event happens while processing a check result not a keepalive message If a check result includes a source attribute a proxy client will be created for the source and the check result will be stored under the newly created client Sensu proxy clients allow Sensu to monitor external resources eg on systems andor devices where a sensuclient cannot be installed such a network switches using the defined check source to create a proxy clients for the external resource Once created proxy clients work much in the same way as any other Sensu client eg they are used to store check execution history and provide context within event data NOTE keepalive monitoring is not supported for proxy clients as they are inherently unable to run a sensuclient Proxy client example Proxy clients are created when a check result includes a source attribute as follows check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite source sensuapporg issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE this source attribute can be provided in a check definition14 or included in a check result published to the Sensu client input socket36 By default proxy client data includes a minimal number of attributes The following is an example of proxy client data that is added to the registry name switchx address unknown subscriptions keepalives false The Sensu API can be used to update proxy client data in the client registry To update proxy client data please refer to the Client API reference documentation9 Create a proxy client via the client socket The following is an example of how to create a proxy client payload via the client socketclientsocketinput using netcat echo source mysql01 name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 How are keepalive events created keepaliveevents Sensu servers including Sensu Enterprise monitor the Sensu client registry for stale client data detecting clients that have failed to send client keepalive messages10 for more than 120 seconds by default When a Sensu server detects that a client hasnt sent a keepalive message within the configured threshold the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create an event this is different from how events are created for monitoring checks see How are Sensu events created11 Client keepalive configuration For more information on configuring client keepalives please see the client keepalive attribute reference documentation12 below Sensu client keepalives are published to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds Client keepalive behavior can be configured per Sensu client allowing each Sensu client to set its own alert thresholds and keepalive event handlers By default client data is considered stale if a keepalive hasnt be received in 120 seconds WARNING By default keepalive events will be sent to the Sensu handler named keepalive if defined or the default handler will be used To configure the keepalive check for a Sensu client please refer to the client keepalive attributes reference documentation12 Client signature Sensu client definitions may specify a unique string identifier as their signature which is included in each keepalive message Once a client advertises a signature via keepalives the server will expect that signature to be present in any keepalives or check results originating from the client Any keepalives or check results which do not contain a matching signature will be dropped with an invalid client signature warning in the log A client can begin to use a signature if one was not previously configured but removing a client signature requires deleting the client Providing a unique client signature prevents other clients from accidentally or maliciously submitting keepalives or check results using the same client name Client subscriptions What is a client subscription whatisasensusubscription Sensus use of the publishsubscribe pattern of communication13 allows for automated registration deregistration of ephemeral systems At the core of this model are Sensu client subscriptions Each Sensu client has a defined set of subscriptions a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc These subscriptions determine which monitoring checks are executed by the client Client subscriptions allow Sensu to request check executions on a group of systems at a time instead of a traditional 11 mapping of configured hosts to monitoring checks Sensu checks target Sensu client subscriptions using the check definition attribute subscribers14 Roundrobin client subscriptions Roundrobin client subscriptions allow checks to be executed on a single client within a subscription in a roundrobin fashion To create a roundrobin client subscription prepend the subscription name with roundrobin eg roundrobinelasticsearch Any check that targets the roundrobinelasticsearch subscription will have its check requests sent to clients in a roundrobin fashion meaning only one member client in the subscription will execute a roundrobin check each time it is published The following is a Sensu client definition that includes a roundrobin subscription client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver roundrobinwebserver The following is a Sensu check definition that targets a roundrobin subscription checks webapplicationapi command checkhttprb u httpslocalhost8080apiv1health subscribers roundrobinwebserver interval 20 Client subscription configuration To configure Sensu client subscriptions for a client please refer to the client subscriptions attribute reference documentation15 In addition to the subscriptions defined in the client configuration Sensu clients also subscribe automatically to a subscription matching their client name For example a client named i424242 will subscribe to check requests for the subscription clienti424242 This makes it possible to generate adhoc check requests targeting specific clients via the request API49 Client socket input What is the Sensu client socket Every Sensu client has a TCP UDP and HTTP socket listening for external check result input The Sensu client sockets listen by default on localhost port 3030 for TCPUDP and 3031 for HTTP and expect JSON formatted check results allowing external sources eg your web application backup scripts etc to push check results without needing to know anything about Sensus internal implementation An excellent client socket use case example is a web application pushing check results to indicate database connectivity issues To configure the Sensu client socket for a client please refer to the client socket attributes16 HTTP Socket The HTTP socket just like the TCP and UDP sockets accepts check results but it requires a wellformed HTTP request and exposes other functionality that is not possible with the raw TCPUDP sockets In exchange for a bit more complexity the HTTP socket interface has the advantage of being more expressive than a raw TCPUDP socket both in the requests that it accepts and how it responds and so exposes more functionality The following endpoints are available for the HTTP socket GET info This endpoint returns 200 OK with some basic Sensu information like the version and transport metrics POST results This endpoint expects an applicationjson body with a check result GET settings This endpoint responds with 200 OK and the sensu configuration Due to the possible sensitive nature of the client settings eg passwords might be in the config this endpoint is protected using HTTP basic authentication and by default the information returned is redacted eg common config keys like password have their values replaced by REDACTED See the redact configuration option if you need control over what is redacted This endpoint accepts the optional query string redactedfalse to disable redaction Refer to the http client socket attributes50 for details on configuring the HTTP basic authentication details that this endpoint requires GET brew This endpoint gets you some fresh coffee Try it Any requests for unknown endpoints will get a 404 with some help information in the body At the moment only unsecure HTTP no HTTPS is supported To configure the Sensu HTTP client socket please refer to the http client socket attributes50 Example client socket usage The following is an example demonstrating external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket The example uses Bashs builtin devtcp file to communicate with the Sensu client socket echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 devtcplocalhost3030 Netcat17 can also be used instead of the TCP file echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 You can do the same using the HTTP socket curl v H ContentType applicationjson X POST d name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 localhost 3031 Creating a dead mans switch The Sensu client sockets in combination with check TTLs can be used to create whats commonly referred to as dead mans switches Outside of the software industry a dead mans switch is a switch that is automatically triggered if a human operator becomes incapacitated source Wikipedia18 Sensu is more interested in detecting silent failures than incapacited human operators By using Check TTLs Sensu is able to set an expectation that a Sensu client will continue to publish results for a check at a regular interval If a Sensu client fails to publish a check result and the check TTL expires Sensu will create an event to indicate the silent failure For more information on check TTLs please refer to the check attributes reference documentation14 A great use case for the Sensu client socket is to create a dead mans switch for backup scripts to ensure they continue to run successfully at regular intervals If an external source sends a Sensu check result with a check TTL to the Sensu client socket Sensu will expect another check result from the same external source before the TTL expires The following is an example of external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket using a check TTL to create a dead mans switch for MySQL backups The example uses a check TTL of 25200 seconds or 7 hours A MySQL backup script using the following code would be expected to continue to send a check result at least once every 7 hours or Sensu will create an event7 to indicate the silent failure echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output backed up mysql successfully sizemb568 status 0 nc localhost 3030 echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output failed to backup mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 Standalone check execution scheduler In addition to subscribing to client subscriptions3 and executing check requests published by the Sensu server19 the Sensu client is able to maintain its ownseparate schedule for standalone checks20 Because the Sensu client shares the same check scheduling algorithm21 as the Sensu server it is not only possible to have consistency between subscription checks22 and standalone checks mdash its also possible to maintain consistency between standalone checks across an entire infrastructure assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP23 Client configuration Example client definition The following is an example Sensu client definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdclientjson This client definition provides Sensu with information about the system on which it resides This is a production system running a web server and a MySQL database The client name attribute is required in the definition and must be unique client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver mysql socket bind 127001 port 3030 Client

configurationexamplesensuconfiguration Toplevel configuration scopestoplevelconfigurationscopes How does Sensu load configuration Sensu configuration sources By default the main configuration file for the Sensu platform is located at etcsensuconfigjson However Sensu also provides support for loading configuration from a directory containing multipledisparate configuration files andor environment variables Sensu merges configuration parameters provided from these three distinct configuration sources environment variables configuration file and configuration directories into a single Hash This type of Hash merging is often called deep merging and is probably the most important concept to understand when learning how to configure Sensu Configuration load order As previously mentioned Sensu configuration can be provided via three distinct sources environment variables a configuration file and one or more directories containing configuration files Sensu loads configuration from these sources in the following order 1 The Sensu service scripts provide command line arguments1 for starting the Sensu services eg the location of the configuration file c the location of configuration directories d etc 2 Sensu will load configuration from environment variables2 3 Sensu loads configuration from the configuration file by default this is located at etcsensuconfigjson 3 Sensu loads configuration snippets from configuration files located in a Sensu configuration directory by default this is etcsensuconfd however it is possible to configure Sensu to load from multiple configuration directories see command line arguments1 below NOTE configuration file load order is dictated by a json glob of the configuration directory as such it is strongly recommended to avoid a dependency on configuration directory file load order eg if youre attempting to name configuration files in the configuration directory to control load order youre doing it wrong Configuration merging configurationmerging To explain how Sensu merges configuration parameters from the various disparate configuration sources please note the following example scenario 1 The Sensu runtime configuration is stored as an inmemory Hash object For the purposes of providing a visual example lets imagine that this Hash object is actually a JSON document which begins life as Sensu is started as an empty JSON document Initial Sensu configuration Hash in memory When Sensu is started it will begin to collect configuration from environment variables a configuration file and one ore more configuration directories which configuration parameters will be used to build up this configuration Hash 2 For the purposes of this example lets assume that the first configuration snippet that Sensu encounters is a configuration file located at etcsensuconfigjson with the following contents New config file on disk at etcsensuconfigjson rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host 100120 port 6379 password secret At this time the Sensu configuration Hash in memory will look like Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host localhost vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret 3 Now lets see what happens when Sensu encounters another configuration snippet eg a file located in a Sensu configuration directory such as etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson New config file contents on disk at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson rabbitmq host 100110 user sensu01 password newsecret The second configuration snippet provided configuration for the rabbitmq scope some of which already exists in the Sensu configuration Hash in memory but also missing some attributes which already exist in the Sensu configuration Hash ie vhost The result of merging this configuration snippet into the Sensu configuration Hash in memory is as follows Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu01 password newsecret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret The result of the deep merge is that the configuration snippet provided by etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson was overlaid on the Sensu configuration Hash in memory essentially overwriting the previously existing values provided by the configuration snippet while not discarding configuration attributes that already existed in the rabbitmq configuration scope even though they werent provided by the configuration snippet Configuration logging As configuration snippets are applied to the Sensu configuration Hash ie during deep merge all configuration changes are logged to the corresponding log file eg the Sensu server API or Client logs Configuration scopes Because Sensu configuration can be provided in so many different sources it is important to understand that ndash regardless of the physical location of the configuration data eg from the main configuration file or from a configuration file in a configuration directory ndash all configuration must be placed in the appropriate scope in the JSON file ie the named level that attributes should be defined in For example the root or scope of the Sensu configuration would be any attributes defined at the top level of a JSON configuration file such as the configuration attributes for rabbitmq redis or the api rabbitmq redis api Attributes defined in the root scope or top level provide the corresponding scopes for additional configuration settings eg the rabbitmq attribute defined above provides the rabbitmq scope a JSON Hash for the actual RabbitMQ configuration settings Configuration scopes are relative Throughout the Sensu documentation whenever a configuration scope is mentioned it is describing the named level that the corresponding configuration attributes should be defined within which may be relative to any potentially related scopes Please note the following examples Configuration scope examples The client scope client In the Sensu Client reference documentation3 it explains that The client definition uses the client definition scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu client configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client client The client socket scope socket The Sensu Client reference documentation3 continues to explain that Sensu clients may have a socket attribute and that there are additional Client Socket attributes4 which should be defined within the socket scope The following attributes are configured within the socket client definition attribute scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu Client Socket configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client and another attribute defined within the client scope or level called socket client socket Thus when the Client Socket reference documentation continues to explain that the bind and port attributes should be defined in the Client Socket scope it means they should live under the socket level of the JSON file regardless of where you might store a configuration file containing said configuration attributes on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu client socket bind 0000 port 3031 Sensu service service configuration sensuservicescriptconfiguration The Sensu services are managed by service scripts that are provided in the Sensu packages The

spawn a new child process at every execution Sensu extensions execute directly inside the EventMachine reactor thread1 of a Sensu client or server process Because they avoid the overhead of spawning a new process at every invocation Sensu extensions can fulfill the same functions as plugins acting as checks filters mutators or handlers but with much greater efficiency WARNING While their performance characteristics are quite desirable Sensu extensions come with major caveats extensions have full access to Sensus internals and any extension which blocks the EventMachine reactor for any

supervision scheme in use eg init runit upstart systemd etc Extensions should be installed directly into the extensions directory When an legacy extension has dependencies on thirdparty Ruby gems or other external applications those dependencies must be installed into the Sensu embedded Ruby environment as well Configuring Sensu Extensions The configurability of Sensu extensions is entirely a function of the extension code For example filters and mutators cannot be applied to an extension via a standard handler definition Instead these aspects of the extensions configuration must be defined in code by overriding the SensuExtensionBase definition method10 EXAMPLE extensionconfigurationincodeexample def definition type extension name name filters occurrences mutator onlycheckoutput end The above code would configure the associated extension to apply the occurrences filter and then the onlycheckoutput mutator prior to executing the extensions custom run method By virtue of being loaded into the Sensu client or server process Sensu extensions have access to the running Sensu configuration As such an extension can make use of any available configuration scopes9 but the prevailing convention is for extensions to use unique toplevel configuration scopes The systemprofile4 extension installed in a previous example looks to the toplevel systemprofile configuration scope The following configuration added to etcsensuconfd would change the systemprofile extensions Graphite path prefix from a default value of system to profile EXAMPLE providingextensionconfigurationexample systemprofile pathprefix profile The sensuextension gem Unlike Sensu plugins which may be written in any programming language Sensu extensions must be written in Ruby The sensuextension5 gem provides SensuExtensionBase and other classes which Sensu extensions should subclass The sensuextensions gem template The sensuextensions gem template12 provides a starting point for those who wish to author their own Sensu extension as a Ruby gem It is recommended that your gem follow the naming pattern sensuextensionNAME in order to ensure it can be easily installed with sensuinstall NOTE if you choose not to use this template for your extension note the directory structure it demonstrates eg placing extension code under libsensuextensions are required to ensure the extension is properly loaded Example extensions For simple examples of Sensu extensions consider the onlycheckoutput mutator6 or the debug handler7 both of which ship with Sensu You can

attributeswhenattributes What are Sensu filters Sensu Filters also called Event Filters allow you to filter events destined for one or more event Handlers1 Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keysvalues with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter recurring events ie to eliminate notification noise and to filter events from systems in preproduction environments When to use a filter Sensu Filters allow you to configure conditional logic to be applied during the event processing flow Compared to executing an event handler evaluating event filters is an inexpensive operation which can provide overall monitoring performance gains by reducing the number of events that need to be handled Additionally by using Sensu Filters instead of building conditional logic into custom Handlers conditional logic can be applied to multiple Handlers and monitoring configuration stays DRY How do Sensu filters work Sensu Filters are applied when Event Handlers1 are configured to use one or more Filters Prior to executing a Handler the Sensu server will apply any Filters configured for the Handler to the Event Data If the Event is not removed by the Filters ie filtered out the Handler will be executed The filter analysis flow performs these steps When the Sensu server is processing an Event it will check for the definition of a handler or handlers Prior to executing each Handler the Sensu server will first apply any configured filter or filters for the Handler If multiple filters are configured for a Handler they are executed sequentially Filter attributes are compared with Event data Filters can be inclusive only matching events are handled or exclusive matching events are not handled As soon as a Filter removes an Event ie filters it out no further analysis is performed and the Event Handler will not be executed NOTE Filters specified in a handler set16 definition have no effect Filters must be specified in individual handler definitions Inclusive and Exclusive Filtering Filters can be inclusive negate false or exclusive negate true Configuring a handler to use multiple inclusive filters is the equivalent of using an AND query operator ie only handle events if they match inclusive filters x AND y AND z Configuring a handler to use multiple exclusive filters is the equivalent of using an OR operator ie only handle events if they dont match x OR y OR z Inclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate false only events that match the defined filter attributes are handled Exclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate true events are only handled if they do not match the defined filter attributes NOTE unless otherwise configured in the filter definition2 the default filtering behavior is inclusive filtering ie negate false Filter attribute comparison Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data3 counterparts For inclusive filter definitions4 ie negate false matching attributes will result in the filter returning a true value for exclusive filter definitions4 ie negate true matching attributes will result in the filter returning a false value ie the event does not pass through the filter Filters that return a true value will continue to be processed mdash via additional filters if defined mutators if defined and handlers EXAMPLE The following example filter definition entitled productionfilter will match event data3 with a custom client definition attribute5 environment production filters productionfilter negate false attributes client environment production Filter attribute evaluation When more complex conditional logic is needed than direct filter attribute comparison10 Sensu filters provide support for attribute evaluation using Ruby expressions When a Filter attribute value is a string beginning with eval the remainder is evaluated as a Ruby expression The Ruby expression is evaluated in a sandbox and provided a single variable value which is equal to the event data attribute value being compared If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match Example Handling state change only Some teams migrating to Sensu have asked about reproducing the behavior of their old monitoring system which alerts only on state change This statechangeonly inclusive4 filter provides such filters statechangeonly negate false attributes occurrences eval value 1 action resolve This eval filter is effective because value of event occurrences is reset on each state change except when the event action is resolve The resolve action is set on an event when its check result status is 0 following one or more prior nonzero statuses Example Handling repeated events The following example filter definition entitled filterinterval60hourly will match event data3 with a check interval6 of 60 seconds and an occurrences value of 1 ie the first occurrence OR any occurrences value that is evenly divisible by 60 via a modulo operator7 calculation ie calculating the remainder after dividing occurrences by 60 Note that negate is true making this an exclusive filter4 if evaluation returns false the event will be handled filters filterinterval60hourly negate true attributes check interval 60 occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 The next example will apply the same logic as the previous example but for checks with a 30 second interval filters filterinterval30hourly negate true attributes check interval 30 occurrences eval value 1 value 120 0 NOTE The effect of both of these filters is that they will only allow an events with 30second or 60second intervals to be handled1 on the first occurrence of the event and again every hour Previous examples in the older Sensu docs have not included the check interval 60 attribute which has confused some users because filtering based on occurrences alone assumes some understanding of the relationship between occurrences and interval which isnt always obvious Example Handling events during office hours only This filter evaluates the event timestamp to determine if the event occurred between 9 AM and 5 PM on a weekday Remember that negate defaults to false so this is an inclusive filter If evaluation returns false the event will not be filters ninetofiver negate false attributes timestamp eval 12345includeTimeatvaluewday Timeatvaluehourbetween917 Filter attribute eval tokens What are filter attribute eval tokens Sensu filters attributes may be evaluated using Ruby expressions10 which evaluations provide support for comparing a single event attribute variable against a basic logical statement eg is value greater than 60 When additional variables are needed beyond the single value variable provided by eval tokens may be used Eval tokens are filter attribute placeholders that can be replaced by Sensu check definition attributes6 and client definition attributes8 including custom attributes Example filter attribute eval token The following is an example Sensu filter definition2 which is using a token checkoccurrences60 as a secondary attribute in the Ruby eval expression The token will be replaced by the check definition attribute6 named occurrences if it is defined otherwise it will use the fallback value of 60 filters occurrences negate true attributes occurrences eval value checkoccurrences60 This example would be useful for filtering events that dont exceed a minimum number of occurrences as configured in the check definition Filter attribute eval token specification Eval token substitution syntax Eval tokens are invoked by wrapping event data attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters before and after the attribute ie Nested event data attributes3 may be accessed via dot notation eg checkoccurrences occurrences would be replaced with the event occurrences data11 checkmythreshold would be replaced with a custom check definition attribute12 called mythreshold Eval token default values Eval token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an eval token attribute13 is not satisfied by event data3 Eval token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for events that are missing the declared token attribute checkoccurrences60 would be replaced with a check definition attribute6 called occurrences If occurrences is not defined in the check definition the default or fallback value of 60 will be used NOTE if an eval token default value is not provided ie as a fallback value and the event data does not contain a matching eval token attribute13 an log entry indicating an error called filter eval unmatched tokens will be published to the Sensu server log Filter configuration Example filter definition examplefilterdefinition The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This is an inclusive filter definition called production The effect of this filter is that only events with the custom client attribute5 environment production will be handled filters production attributes client environment production negate false Filter definition specification Filter naming Each filter definition has a unique name used for the definition key

email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty ServiceNow etc or storing metrics in a timeseries database eg Graphite Handler types There are several types of handlers The most common handler type is the pipe handler which works very similarly to how checks3 work enabling Sensu to interact with almost any computer program via standard streams4 Pipe handlers Pipe handlers pipe event data into arbitrary commands via STDIN TCPUDP handlers TCP and UDP handlers send event data to a remote socket eg external API Transport handlers Transport handlers publish event data to the Sensu transport5 Handler sets Handler sets also called set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easy to manage groups of actions that should be executed for certain types of events The default handler Sensu expects all events2 to have a corresponding handler Event handlers may be configured in check definitions16 however if no handler or handlers have been configured Sensu will attempt to handle the event using a handler named15 default The default handler is only a reference ie Sensu does not provide a builtin default handler so if no handler definition exists for a handler named default Sensu will log an error indicating that the event was not handled because a default handler definition does not exist To use one or more existing handlers as the default you can create a Set handler17 called default and include the existing handlers in the set Pipe handlers Pipe handlers are external commands that can consume event data6 via STDIN Example pipe handler definition handlers examplepipehandler type pipe command dosomethingawesomerb o options Pipe handler commands What is a pipe handler command Pipe handler definitions include a command attribute which are literally executable commands which will be executed on a Sensu server1 as the sensu user Pipe handler command arguments Pipe handler command attributes may include command line arguments for

above all pipe handlers are executed by a Sensu server1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu server system ie installed in a system PATH directory7 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command handlerircrb TCPUDP handlers tcpudphandlers TCP and UDP handlers enable Sensu to forward event data to arbitrary TCP or UDP socketst for external services to consume eg thirdparty APIs Example TCP handler definition The following example TCP handler definition will forward event data6 to a TCP socket8 ie 1001994444 and will timeout if an acknowledgement ACK is not received within 30 seconds handlers exampletcphandler type tcp timeout 30 socket host 100199 port 4444 The following example UDP handler definition will forward event data6 to a UDP socket ie 100199444 handlers exampleudphandler type udp socket host 100199 port 4444 Transport handlers Transport handlers enable Sensu to publish event data to named queues on the Sensu transport5 for external services to consume Example transport handler definition The following example transport handler definition will publish event data6 to the Sensu transport on a pipe eg a queue or channel etc named examplehandlerqueue One or more instances of an external process or thirdparty application would need to subscribe to the named pipe to process the events handlers exampletransporthandler type transport pipe type direct name examplehandlerqueue Handler sets Handler set definitions allow groups of handlers ie individual collections of actions to take on event data to be referenced via a single named handler set NOTE Attributes defined on handler sets do not apply to the handlers they include For example filter filters and mutator attributes defined in a handler set will have no effect Example handler set definition The following example handler set definition will execute three handlers ie email slack and pagerduty for every

data payload ie a event data1 Output JSON data the modified event data to STDOUT or STDERR Produce an exit status code to indicate state 0 indicates OK exit status codes other than 0 indicates a failure When to use a mutator Many Sensu event handlers2 will modify event data1 in the course of processing an event9 and in many cases this is recommended because modifying the event data and performing some action in memory in the same process will result in better performance than executing a mutator5 and a handler two separate processes However when multiple handlers require similar event data modifications mutators provide the ability to avoid code duplication DRY and simplify event handler logic How do Sensu mutators work Sensu mutators are applied when event handlers2 are configured to use a mutator Prior to executing a Handler the Sensu server will execute the configured mutator If the mutator is successfully executed the modified event data is then provided to the

What is the Sensu server The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests1 to client subscriptions2 via a PublishSubscribe model3 and provides a scalable event processing platform4 for processing check results and monitoring events Sensu Core vs Sensu Enterprise The Sensu server comes in two flavors the opensource Sensu Core5 via the sensuserver process and Sensu Enterprise6 via the sensuenterprise process To learn more about the differences between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise please visit the Sensu website7 NOTE Sensu Enterprise ie the sensuenterprise process was designed to be a dropin replacement for the Sensu Core server and API ie the sensuserver and sensuapi As such any mention of the Sensu server in the Sensu documentation also applies to the sensuenterprise process for Sensu Enterprise users WARNING as noted above the sensuenterprise process is designed to replace both of the Sensu Core sensuserver and sensuapi processes Because Sensu Enterprise will load the same configuration as Sensu Core it is important that the Sensu Core processes are stopped before starting Sensu Enterprise to avoid known conflicts and processing errors such as attempting to bind on the same ports etc Check execution scheduling Check execution scheduling is performed by a Sensu server see Sensu server task election8 Checks are scheduled by querying Sensus configuration for defined checks ndash excluding check with the attributes standalone true or publish false ndash and calculating when executions should occur based on their defined intervals Check scheduling algorithm synchronization checkschedulingalgorithmsynchronization Sensu uses an internal algorithm for determining a unique cadence for Sensu checks which uniqueness is based on the check name and interval This algorithm outputs a value in milliseconds which the Sensu server will use as an offset before the next check request should be published In practice this means that ndash assuming system clocks are in sync between disparate Sensu servers ndash check requests for a given check based on the check name will be published at the exact same time The also means that in the event of a Sensu server restart andor Sensu server task reelection ie if a new Sensu server is elected to become reponsible for check execution scheduling check execution scheduling intervals will remain consistent In fact because this algorithm is also shared by the Sensu client ndash which provides decentralized check execution scheduling in the form of standalone checks22 ndash a check defined on the Sensu server and a matching standalone check defined on a Sensu client should also stay in sync with each other again assuming that system clocks are in sync and the check names and intervals are consistent Event processing The Sensu server provides a scalable event processor Event processing involves conversion of check results9 into Sensu events and then applying any defined event filters10 event data mutators11 and event handlers12 All event processing happens on a Sensu server system The event processing workflow happens in the following order Event Filter Mutator Handler NOTE events that are filtered out ie removed by Sensu event filtersfilters will not continue to be mutated by event data mutatorsmutators or event handlershandlers Sensus event processing capabilities can be distributed among multiple Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster For more information on configuring a Sensu cluster please see Scaling Sensu13 below Automated task election The Sensu server processes ie sensuserver and sensuenterprise are designed to scale horizontally14 ie by adding systems No additional configuration is required to run a cluster of Sensu servers other than the location of the transport15 and data store16 When Sensu servers start they participate in an election process to automatically distribute tasks A Sensu server may be elected for more than one task A server task can only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart All Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster monitor the state of task execution on a 10second interval automatically electing a new Sensu server for a task if the current one hasnt confirmed execution in more than 30 seconds Server tasks In a Sensu server cluster responsibility for a distinct set of tasks is distributed amongst members of the cluster The tasks only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart When adding Sensu servers to a cluster restarting the existing Sensu servers in the cluster will force a redistribution of tasks Check request

and native silencingcomparingstashbasedandnativesilencing Migrating from stashbased silencingmigratingfromstashbasedsilencing What is Sensu Silencing As check results0 are processed by a Sensu server the server executes event handlers1 to send alerts to personnel or otherwise relay event data to external services Although event handlers can be directly configured with filters11 to improve overall signaltonoise ratio there are many scenarios in which operators receiving notifications from Sensu require an ondemand means to suppress alerts Sensus builtin silencing provides the means to suppress execution of event handlers on an adhoc basis By using a dashboard or other tool to interact with the silenced API2 operators can mute notifications onthefly The silenced API manipulates silencing entries in the Sensu data store These entries describe a combination of check name and subscription When the check name3 andor subscription4 described in a silencing entry match an event the handler will not be executed and an informational message will be logged Individual handlers may optout of silencing by configuring the handlesilenced attribute5 NOTE Silencing described in this reference document is implemented in Sensu version 026 or later and Sensu Enterprise 20 or later When to use silencing Silencing is used to prevent handlers from being triggered based on the check name present in a check result or the subscriptions associated with the client that published the check result This can be desirable in many scenarios giving operators the ability to quiet incoming alerts while coordinating their response Sensu silencing entries make it possible to Silence all checks on a specific clientsilenceallchecksonaspecificclient Silence a specific check on a specific

above combinations silencing entries support Expiration after a specified number of seconds Expiration after check returns to OK state resolves Describing the reason or rationale Describing the creator or entity responsible for an entry How does silencing work Silencing entries are created on an adhoc basis via the silenced API2 endpoint When silencing entries are successfully created via the API they are assigned an ID in the format SUBSCRIPTIONCHECK where SUBSCRIPTION is the name of a Sensu client subscription and CHECK is the name of a Sensu check Silencing entries can be used to silence checks on specific clients by by taking advantage of perclient subscriptions4 added in Sensu 026 eg clientCLIENTNAME These silencing entries are persisted to the silenced registry in the Sensu data store10 When the Sensu server processes subsequent check results it consults this registry to determine whether or not a matching silencing entry exists If one or more matching entries exist in the registry the event context for the check result is updated to indicate that the event is silenced and the ID of the entries which the check result matched When creating a silencing entry a combination of check and subscription can be specified but only one or the other is strictly required For example when a silencing entry is created specifying only a check its ID will contain an asterisk or wildcard in the SUBSCRIPTION position This indicates that any event with a matching check name will be marked as silenced regardless of the originating clients subscriptions Conversely a silencing entry which specifies only a subscription will have an ID with an asterisk in the CHECK position This indicates that any event where the originating clients subscriptions match the subscription specified in the entry will be marked as silenced regardless of the check name NOTE Starting with version 026 Sensu clients automatically add a subscription containing their client name prefixed with the string client For example client i424242 will automatically add subscription clienti424242 Silencing checks at the individual client level requires clients to run Sensu 026 or be manually configured with a client subscription Silencing entry specification Silencing entries are composed as a JSON document containing at least one of the required subscription or check attributes and additional optional attributes as desired Silencing entries are created updated and deleted by submitting JSON documents to endpoints on the silenced API2 via HTTP POST as shown in the examples

connection would use a different certificate allowing them to be individually revoked There is currently no way to tell RabbitMQ to reject a certificate If the integrity of a certificate is compromised it is common practice to regenerate and redistribute the certificate authority and certificates This process is greatly simplified with the use of configuration management tools In the future the Sensu project hopes to be able to provide a better mechanism for distributing individual certificates and providing fastsimple revocation facilities 1 transport 2 httpwwwrabbitmqcomsslhtml

installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses Redisreferenceredis as a data store and the Sensu server services ie sensuserver sensuapi for Sensu Core sensuenterprise for Sensu Enterprise require access to the same Redis instance or cluster to store and access the Sensu client registry check results check execution history and current event data Do check definitions need to exist on every system I wish to monitor No Check definitions can be written as publishsubscribe pubsub or standalone Pubsub checks which specify a list of subscribers need only be configured on the Sensu server Standalone checks which are scheduled and executed by the Sensu client need only be configured on the clients where they should be run Where should check plugin executables be installed Regardless of where checks are defined the actual check executables need to exist on the filesystem for the Sensu client to execute them Check plugin executables can be installed in etcsensuplugins or optsensuembeddedbin the latter being the location where plugin executables are installed via sensuinstall What is a standalone check A standalone check is a check definition that is installed on and executed by the Sensu client without being scheduled by the Sensu server Standalone checks defer Check execution scheduling responsibilitiesoverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler to Sensu clients enabling decentralized management of monitoring checks and distribution of scheduling responsibilities Standalone checks may be used in conjunction with pubsub checks and are distinguished from pubsub checks by inclusion of the standalone true configuration parameter What happens if a single check is defined on both the Sensu server and client When a check request is published for a check defined on the Sensu server the Sensu client will look for a local definition matching the check name prior to executing the check If a local definition exists it is mergedreferenceconfigurationconfigurationmerging with the definition provided by the server with any local definition attributes overriding the definition provided by the Sensu server What is Sensu Client safemode In safemode a client will not run a check published by a Sensu server unless that check is also defined on the client Safe mode must be enabled on the Sensu Client via the safemode configuration attribute Can multiple Sensu servers be run concurrently in a cluster Yes Sensu is designed to be scaled horizontally ie by adding additional Sensu servers It supports fully automated leader election ensuring that a single Sensu server acts as a centralized Check Execution Scheduleroverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler automated failover automatically electing a new leader if the previous leader is unexpectedly unavailable and distributed event processing check results are distributed across all Sensu servers in a roundrobin fashion Running more than one Sensu server is highly recommended for performance and availability How are new systems registered Automatically Sensu clients register themselves when they start up The Sensu client process requires access to the Sensu Transportreferencetransport by default this is RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq see Sensu Configurationreferenceconfigurationtoplevelconfigurationscopes and some minimal client configuration eg a name address and one or more subscriptions in order to start When the Sensu client process starts it begins sending keepalives ndash a special type of check result containing client configuration data

you The Sensu client software allows you to register a running instance of itself as capable of running any checks they might be eligible for Infrastructure sometimes includes hardware or services that dont necessarily support running the Sensu client software but still needs to be monitored For those cases proxy clientsproxyclients let you monitor anything you can tell Sensu about Adding a Sensu Client One of the first challenges new Sensu users often encounter is learning what is required to get a remote Sensu client1 to communicate with the Sensu server2 If youre in a hurry skip ahead to add a remote Sensu client3 for stepbystep instructions Alternatively once you understand the two requirements for adding Sensu clients youll know everything you need to start deploying Sensu clients to your entire infrastructure Please continue reading to learn how adding Sensu clients starts with configuration4 and is ultimately all about the transport5 It starts with configuration Sensu is designed to be operated via configuration This core philosophy is what enables Sensu to work so seamlessly with modern automation solutions and configuration management platforms To learn more about how Sensu is configured please consult the Sensu configuration reference documentation6 The Sensu client requires a minimal amount of configuration to enable it to automatically register itself7 with the Sensu server which configuration includes a client definition8 eg the client name address and subscriptions and a transport definition9 Its all about the transport The Sensu processes use a transport10 a message bus for communication By default this is RabbitMQ11 but modern versions of Sensu have added support for alternative transports12 including Redis13 Without a transport connection a Sensu client will be unable to send monitoring data eg keepalive messages14 check results15 etc In order to connect to the transport the Sensu client will need three pieces of information Which transport to use this tells Sensu which transport library should it load and which configuration scope should it use to obtain connection details A valid transport definition this provides Sensu with an IP address or hostname and any security credentials needed to connect to the transport Network access to the transport socket ie the Sensu client will need outbound network access and the transport will need to be configured to listen for remote network connections Add a remote Sensu client With the exception of Sensu clients that are running on the Sensu server which is very useful and strongly recommended all Sensu clients are essentially remote clients as they have to establish network communication to send monitoring data eg client keepalives14 and check results15 Please note the following steps that are required to add a remote Sensu client 1 Configure the client Create a client definition located at etcsensuconfdclientjson with the following contents replacing the values for the client name address and subscriptions with the corresponding values for the client you are adding client name i041256 address 8888 subscriptions default webserver 2 Tell the client which transport to use Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdtransportjson with the following contents replacing the value for the transport name with the corresponding value for the transport you are using eg use transport redis if you are using the Redis transport transport name rabbitmq reconnectonerror true 3 Tell the client how to connect to the transport Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson or etcsensuconfdredisjson if you are using the Redis transport NOTE please consult the corresponding reference documentation for RabbitMQ11 or Redis13 for more configuration examples and detailed information on how to configure Sensus connection 4 Start the client Start the Sensu client and verify connectivity by consulting the Sensu client log file NOTE The service command will not work on CentOS 5 the sysvinit script must be used eg sudo etcinitdsensuclient start sudo service sensuclient start Proxy Clients Sometimes a logical piece of infrastructure isnt a device we can run Sensu on Fundamentally Sensu gives you the flexibility to separate how checks run from where they run which lets you monitor arbitrary named black box devices or services For example you may have a router that you cant run Sensu on but publishes interesting information over SNMP that you want to gather metrics from Or maybe your monitor which other datacenters are visibleonline to you or have any number of creative use cases You can create a proxy client16 that can have attributes for use in check execution allowing you to use the client registry naturally for managed an unmanaged infrastructure See the reference for creating proxy clients16 or details on writing checks against them17 for more Troubleshooting 1 referenceclients 2 referenceserver 3

Sensu monitoring check in this guide demonstrates one or more check definition features for more information please refer to the Sensu checks reference documentation1 Objectives What will be covered in this guide Creation of standard checks functional tests Creation of metric collection checks server resources etc Creation of metric analysis checks querying time series data etc What are Sensu checks whataresensuchecks Sensu checks allow you to monitor server resources services and application health as well as collect analyze metrics they are executed on servers running the Sensu client Checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state The common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Create a standard check Standard Sensu checks are used to determine the health of server resources services and applications A standard check will query a resource for information to determine its state Once a standard check has determined the resource state it outputs a human readable message and exits with the appropriate exit status code to indicate its stateseverity OK WARNING etc Monitor the cron service The following instructions install the check dependencies and configure the Sensu check definition in order to monitor the Cron service Install dependencies checkcroninstalldependencies The checkprocessrb script provided by the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 can reliably detect if a service such as Cron is running or not The following instructions will install the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkprocessrb script sudo sensuinstall p processchecks006 Create the check definition for Cron The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcheckcronjson This check definition uses the checkprocessrb script installed above3 to determine if the Cron service is running The check is named cron and it runs checkprocessrb p cron on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 60 seconds interval NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron subscribers production interval 60 For a full listing of the checkprocessrb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbincheckprocessrb h Currently the Cron check definition requires that check requests be sent to Sensu clients with the production subscription This is known as pubsub check Optionally a check may use standalone mode which allows clients to schedule their own check executions The following is an example of the Cron check using standalone mode true The Cron check will now be executed every 60 seconds on each Sensu client with the check definition A Sensu check definition with standalone true does not need to specify subscribers checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 By default Sensu checks use the default Sensu event handler for events they create To specify a different Sensu event handler for a check use the handler attribute The debug event handler used in this example will log the Sensu event data to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 handler debug Using multiple handlers To specify multiple Sensu event handlers use the handlers attribute plural NOTE if both handler and handlers plural check definition attributes are used handlers will take precedence checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron

collection checks can output metric data in a variety of metric formats Graphite plaintext4 Nagios Performance Data5 OpenTSDB6 Metrics 20 wire format7 Measuring CPU utilization Install dependencies

example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcpumetricsjson This check definition uses the metricscpurb script installed above9 to collect CPU metrics and output them in the Graphite plaintext format By default Sensu checks with an exit status code of 0 for OK do not create events unless they indicate a change in state from a nonzero status to a zero status ie resulting in a resolve action see Sensu Events10 Metric collection checks will output metric data regardless of the check exit status code however they usually exit 0 To ensure events are always created for a metric collection check the check type of metric is used The check is named cpumetrics and it runs metricscpurb on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 10 seconds

Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cpumetrics type metric command metricscpurb subscribers production interval 10 handler debug For a full listing of the metricscpurb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbinmetricscpurb h Create a metric analysis check A metric analysis check analyzes metric data which may or may not have been collected by a metrics collection check11 By querying external metric stores eg Graphite to perform data evaluations metric analysis checks allow you to perform powerful analytics based on trends in metric data rather than a single data point For example where monitoring and alerting on a single CPU utilization data point can result in false positive events based on momentary spikes monitoring and alerting on CPU utilization data over a specified period of time will improve alerting accuracy Because metric analysis checks require interaction with an external metric store providing a functional example is outside of the scope of this guide However assuming the existence of a Graphite installation that is populated with metric data the following example checks could be used The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 The check queries Graphite for a calculated moving average using the last 10 data points of the load balancer session count The session count moving average is compared with the provided alert thresholds A Sensu client running on the Graphite server would be responsible for scheduling and executing this check standalone mode NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks sessioncount command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t movingAveragelb1assetsbackendsessioncurrent10 w 100 c 200 standalone true interval 30 The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 for disk capacity metrics The Graphite API query uses highestCurrent to grab only the highest disk capacity metric to be compared with the provided alert thresholds This check will trigger an event alert when one or more disks on any machine are at the configured capacity threshold In this example configuration the check is configured to warn at 85 capacity w 85 and to raise a critical alert at 95 capacity c 95 checks diskcapacity command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t highestCurrentdiskcapacity1 w 85 c 95 a 120 standalone true interval 30 The following instructions will install the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkgraphitedatarb script sudo sensuinstall p graphite006 Checking on Other Clients proxyclients Sensu supports running checks where the results are considered to be for a client that isnt actually the one executing the check regardless of whether that client is a Sensu client or simply a proxy client14 There are a number of reasons for this use case but fundamentally Sensu handles it the same Checks are scheduled normally but by specifying a Proxy Request13 in your check clients that match certain definitions their clientattributes cause the check to run for each one The attributes supplied must normally match exactly as stated no variables or directives have any special meaning but you can still use eval to perform more complicated filtering with Ruby on the available value such as finding clients with particular subscriptions given that were dealing with

an event filter Creation of an event filter with Ruby and math What are Sensu filters whataresensufilters Sensu filters allow you to filter out events destined for one or more event handlers Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keyvalues pairs with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter event recurrences to eliminate notification noise and to filter events that are not for production machines Create an event filter Inclusive filtering The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This filter definition will include events that match the filter criteria In this example the filter itself is named production which matches events with a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production Exclusive filtering To exclude events based on filter criteria set the negate filter definition attribute to true In this example the production filter will match events that do not have a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production negate true Using a filter To use the production filter for an event handler set the filter attribute in the handler definition For example handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filter production Using multiple filters To specify multiple Sensu event filters use the filters attribute plural NOTE if both filter and filters plural handler definition attributes are used filters will take precedence handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filters production operations Create an event filter with Ruby and math Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data counterparts via Ruby object comparison However it is also possible to use Ruby expressions to evaluate event data attribute values When a filter attribute value is a string that begins with eval the remainder of the string is evaluated as a Ruby expression The event data attribute value is provided to the Ruby expression as a variable entitled value If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match This Ruby expression evaluation is performed in a sandbox for safety The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterrecurrencesjson This filter excludes events that are not the first event occurrence and those that do not have an occurrence count divisible by 60 without a remainder recurrence Logically if checks with an execution interval of 1 minute are generating events every minute

taking action on events2 produced by check results such as sending an email alert creating or resolving a PagerDuty incident or storing metrics in Graphite There are several types of handlers pipe tcp udp transport and set Pipe handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the created process via STDIN TCP and UDP handlers send the event data to a remote socket Transport handlers publish the event data to the Sensu transport by default this is RabbitMQ Set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easier to manage many event handlers Create a pipe handler Pipe event handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the corresponding process via STDIN Install dependencies The following instructions install the eventfile Sensu handler plugin written in Ruby to etcsensupluginseventfilerb This handler plugin reads the event data via STDIN parses it creates a file name using the parsed event data and then writes the event data to the file eg

RESTful APIrestfulapi Architectural Diagram Sensu Architecture Gifimagessensudiagramgif Secure Transport Sensu services use a message bus eg RabbitMQ1 to communicate with one another technically speaking the Sensu services dont actually communicate with each other they only communicate with the message bus As of Sensu Core version 013 this message bus communication in Sensu has been abstracted as the Sensu Transport2 making it possible to leverage alternate transport solutions in place of RabbitMQ the default Transport Sensu services requires access to the same instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these

Service checks provide status and telemetry data and event handlers process results Hundreds of plugins are available for monitoring the tools and services youre already using Plugins have a very simple specification and can be written in any programming language Built for missioncritical applications and multitiered networks Sensus use of a secure transport8 protects your infrastructure from exposure and makes it possible for Sensu to traverse complex network topologies including those that use NAT and VPNs and span public networks Sensu provides a secure monitoring solution trusted by international banking institutions government agencies Fortune 100 organizations and many more Designed for automation Sensu exposes 100 of its configuration as JSON files which makes it extremely automationndashfriendly eg it was designed to work with tools like Chef9 Puppet10 and Ansible11 Open source software with commercial support Sensu is an opensource software OSS project made freely available under a permissive MIT License12 the source code is publicly available on GitHub13 Sensu Enterprise14 is based on Sensu Core the OSS version of Sensu which makes addedvalue features commercial support training and many other benefits available under the Sensu License15 A Simple Yet Powerful Framework Sensu is a comprehensive monitoring solution that is powerful enough to solve complex monitoring problems at scale yet simple enough to use for traditional monitoring scenarios and small environments It achieves this broad appeal via building upon two simple yet powerful monitoring primitives Service Checks16 and Event Processing7 These building blocks also provide an infinitely extensible framework for composing monitoring solutions What is a Service Check servicechecks Service checks allow you to monitor services eg is Nginx running or measure resources eg how much disk space do I have left Service checks are executed on machines running a monitoring agent ie Sensu client17 Service checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state Common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Service checks produce results that are processed by the event processor ie the Sensu server Learn more 17 What is Event Processing eventprocessing Event processing also called stream processing is a method of analyzing processing and storing streams of information data about things that happen events deriving a conclusion from them and potentially executing some action handling The Sensu event processor the Sensu server enables you to execute Handlers18 for taking action on events produced by service checks such as sending an email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty or ServiceNow or storing metric data in a timeseries database eg Graphite Learn more 18 1 httpswwwpagerdutycom 2 httpsslackcom 3 httpwwwhipchatcom 4 referenceplugins 5 referenceenterprisebuiltinintegrations 6

client1 which monitor a condition eg is Nginx running or collect measurements eg how much disk space do I have left Although the Sensu client will attempt to execute any command defined for a check successful processing of check results requires adherence to a simple specification Sensu check specification Result data is output to STDOUT or STDERR2 For standard checks this output is typically a humanreadable message For metrics checks this output contains the measurements gathered by the check Exit status code indicates state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an UNKNOWN or custom status PRO TIP Those familiar with the Nagios3 monitoring system may recognize this specification as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins As a result Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu without any modification At every execution of a check command ndash regardless of success or failure ndash the Sensu client publishes the checks result4 for eventual handling by the event processor5 ie the Sensu server6 Check commands What is a check command Each Sensu check definition7 defines a command and the interval at which it should be executed Check commands are literally executable commands which will be executed on the Sensu client1 run as the sensu user Most check commands are provided by Sensu check plugins8 Check command arguments Sensu check command attributes may include command line arguments for controlling the behavior of the command executable Most Sensu check plugins8 provide support for command line arguments for reusability How and where are check commands executed As mentioned above all check commands are executed by Sensu clients1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu client system ie installed in a system PATH directory9 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg Check execution platform How are checks scheduled Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu serverserver and the Sensu client10 monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model11 ie subscription checkssubscriptionchecks The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks12 on the local system only Because Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive any Sensu client may be configured to both schedule and execute its own standalone checks as well as execute subscription checks scheduled by the Sensu server Subscription checks Sensu checks which are centrally defined and scheduled by the Sensu server6 are called subscription checks Sensus use of a message bus transport13 for communication enables topicbased communication14 mdash where messages are published to a specific topic and consumers subscribe to one or more specific topics This form of communication is commonly referred to as the publishsubscribe pattern11 or pubsub for short Subscription checks have a defined set of subscribers15 a list of transport13 topics14 that check requests will be published to Sensu clients become subscribers to these topics ie subscriptions via their individual client definition16 subscriptions attribute In practice subscriptions will typically correspond to a specific role andor responsibility eg a webserver database etc Subscriptions are a powerful primitives in the monitoring context because they allow you to effectively monitor for specific behaviors or characteristics corresponding to the function being provided by a particular system For example disk capacity thresholds might be more important or at least different on a database server as opposed to a webserver conversely CPU andor memory usage thresholds might be more important on a caching system than on a file server Subscriptions also allow you to configure check requests for an entire group or subgroup of systems rather than require a traditional 11 mapping Standalone checks Sensu checks which are defined on a Sensu client1 with the check definition attribute17 standalone set to true are called standalone checks The Sensu client provides its own scheduler10 for scheduling standalone checks which ensures scheduling consistency between Sensu clients with identical check definitions assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP18 Standalone checks are an important complement to subscription checks19 because they provide a decentralized management alternative for Sensu Check results What is a check result A check result is a JSON20 document published as a message on the Sensu transport13 by the Sensu client upon completion of a check execution Sensu check results include the check definition attributes17 eg command subscribers interval name etc including custom attributes21 the client name the result was submitted from and the output of the check Example check result output check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE please refer to the check result specification38 below for more information about check results Check token substitution What is check token substitution Sensu check definitions17 may include attributes that you may wish to override on a clientbyclient basis For example check commands23 ndash which may include command line arguments23 for controlling the behavior of the check command ndash may benefit from clientspecific thresholds etc Sensu check tokens are check definition placeholders that will be replaced by the Sensu client with the corresponding client definition attribute16 values including custom attributes24 NOTE Sensu check tokens were formerly known as check command tokens which limited token substitution to the check command attribute command tokens were also sometimes referred to as Sensu client overrides a reference to the fact that command tokens allowed client attributes to override check command arguments23 NOTE Check tokens are processed before check execution therefore token substitution will not apply to check data delivered via the local client socket input46 Example check tokens The following is an example Sensu check definition17 using three check tokens for check command arguments23 In this example the checkdiskusagerb command accepts w warning and c critical arguments to indicate the thresholds as percentages for creating warning or critical events As configured this check will create a warning event at 80 disk capacity unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskwarning80 and a critical event will be created if disk capacity reaches 90 unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskcritical90 This example also creates a custom check definition attribute called environment which will default to a value of production unless a different value is provided by the client definition ie environmentproduction checks checkdiskusage command checkdiskusagerb w diskwarning80 c diskcritical90 subscribers production interval 60 environment environmentproduction The following example Sensu client definition16 would provide the necessary attributes to override the diskwarning diskcritical and environment tokens declared above client name i424242 address 1002100 subscriptions production webserver mysql disk warning 75 critical 85 environment development Check token specification Token substitution syntax Check tokens are invoked by wrapping references to client attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters ie Nested Sensu client definition attributes16 can be accessed via dot notation eg diskwarning address would be replaced with the client address attribute26 url would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url diskwarning would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called warning nested inside of a JSON hash called disk Token substitution default values checktokendefaultvalues Check token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an attribute is not provided by the client definition16 Check token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for clients that are missing the declared token attribute urlhttpssensuapporg would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url If no such attribute called url is included in the client definition the default or fallback value of httpssensuapporg will be used Unmatched tokens If a token substitution default value25 is not provided ie as a fallback value and the Sensu client definition does not have a matching definition attribute a check result4 indicating unmatched tokens will be published for the check execution eg Unmatched check tokens diskwarning Check configuration Example check definition The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdchecksensuwebsitejson This check definition uses a Sensu plugin27 named checkhttprb28 to ensure that the Sensu website is still available The check is named sensuwebsite and it runs on Sensu clients with the production subscription15 at an interval of 60 seconds checks sensuwebsite command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers production interval 60 contact ops Check definition

attributescustomattributes What is a Sensu client Sensu clients are monitoring agents1 which are installed and run on every system eg server container etc that needs to be monitored The client is responsible for registering the system with Sensu sending client keepalive2 messages the Sensu heartbeat mechanism and executing monitoring checks Each client is a member of one or more subscriptions3 ndash a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc Sensu clients will subscribe to or watch for check requests4 published by the Sensu server5 via the Sensu Transport6 execute the corresponding requests locally and publish the results of the check back to the transport to be processed by a Sensu server Client keepalives What is a client keepalive Sensu Client keepalives are the heartbeat mechanism used by Sensu to ensure that all registered Sensu clients are still operational and able to reach the Sensu Transport6 Sensu clients publish keepalive messages containing client configuration data to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds If a Sensu client fails to send keepalive messages over a period of 120 seconds by default the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create a keepalive event7 Keepalives can be used to identify unhealthy systems and network partitions among other things and keepalive events can trigger email notifications and other useful actions Client registration the client registry registrationandregistry In practice client registrations happens when a Sensu server processes a client keepalive message for a client that is not already registered in the Sensu client registry based on the configured client name or source attribute This client registry is stored in the Sensu data store8 and is accessible via the Sensu Clients API9 All Sensu client data provided in client keepalive messages gets stored in the client registry which data is used to add context to Sensu Events7 and to detect Sensu clients in an unhealthy state Registration events If a Sensu event handler30 named registration is configured or if a Sensu client definition includes a registration attribute31 the Sensu server5 will create and process a Sensu event7 for the client registration applying any configured filters26 and mutators32 before executing the configured handlers30 Registration events are useful for executing onetime handlers for new Sensu clients For example registration event handlers can be used to update external Configuration Management Databases CMDBs34 such as ServiceNow35 etc To configure a registration event handler please refer to the Sensu event handler documentation30 for instructions on creating a handler named registration Alternatively please see Client definition registration attributes31 below WARNING registration events are not stored in the event registry in the Sensu data store8 so they are not accessible via the Sensu API however all registration events are logged in the Sensu server5 log Proxy clients Sensu proxy clients formerly known as Justintime or JIT clients are dynamically created clients added to the client registry if a client does not already exist for a check result Proxy client registration differs from keepalivebased registration because the registration event happens while processing a check result not a keepalive message If a check result includes a source attribute a proxy client will be created for the source and the check result will be stored under the newly created client Sensu proxy clients allow Sensu to monitor external resources eg on systems andor devices where a sensuclient cannot be installed such a network switches using the defined check source to create a proxy clients for the external resource Once created proxy clients work much in the same way as any other Sensu client eg they are used to store check execution history and provide context within event data NOTE keepalive monitoring is not supported for proxy clients as they are inherently unable to run a sensuclient Proxy client example Proxy clients are created when a check result includes a source attribute as follows check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite source sensuapporg issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE this source attribute can be provided in a check definition14 or included in a check result published to the Sensu client input socket36 By default proxy client data includes a minimal number of attributes The following is an example of proxy client data that is added to the registry name switchx address unknown subscriptions keepalives false The Sensu API can be used to update proxy client data in the client registry To update proxy client data please refer to the Client API reference documentation9 Create a proxy client via the client socket The following is an example of how to create a proxy client payload via the client socketclientsocketinput using netcat echo source mysql01 name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 How are keepalive events created keepaliveevents Sensu servers including Sensu Enterprise monitor the Sensu client registry for stale client data detecting clients that have failed to send client keepalive messages10 for more than 120 seconds by default When a Sensu server detects that a client hasnt sent a keepalive message within the configured threshold the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create an event this is different from how events are created for monitoring checks see How are Sensu events created11 Client keepalive configuration For more information on configuring client keepalives please see the client keepalive attribute reference documentation12 below Sensu client keepalives are published to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds Client keepalive behavior can be configured per Sensu client allowing each Sensu client to set its own alert thresholds and keepalive event handlers By default client data is considered stale if a keepalive hasnt be received in 120 seconds WARNING By default keepalive events will be sent to the Sensu handler named keepalive if defined or the default handler will be used To configure the keepalive check for a Sensu client please refer to the client keepalive attributes reference documentation12 Client signature Sensu client definitions may specify a unique string identifier as their signature which is included in each keepalive message Once a client advertises a signature via keepalives the server will expect that signature to be present in any keepalives or check results originating from the client Any keepalives or check results which do not contain a matching signature will be dropped with an invalid client signature warning in the log A client can begin to use a signature if one was not previously configured but removing a client signature requires deleting the client Providing a unique client signature prevents other clients from accidentally or maliciously submitting keepalives or check results using the same client name Client subscriptions What is a client subscription whatisasensusubscription Sensus use of the publishsubscribe pattern of communication13 allows for automated registration deregistration of ephemeral systems At the core of this model are Sensu client subscriptions Each Sensu client has a defined set of subscriptions a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc These subscriptions determine which monitoring checks are executed by the client Client subscriptions allow Sensu to request check executions on a group of systems at a time instead of a traditional 11 mapping of configured hosts to monitoring checks Sensu checks target Sensu client subscriptions using the check definition attribute subscribers14 Roundrobin client subscriptions Roundrobin client subscriptions allow checks to be executed on a single client within a subscription in a roundrobin fashion To create a roundrobin client subscription prepend the subscription name with roundrobin eg roundrobinelasticsearch Any check that targets the roundrobinelasticsearch subscription will have its check requests sent to clients in a roundrobin fashion meaning only one member client in the subscription will execute a roundrobin check each time it is published The following is a Sensu client definition that includes a roundrobin subscription client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver roundrobinwebserver The following is a Sensu check definition that targets a roundrobin subscription checks webapplicationapi command checkhttprb u httpslocalhost8080apiv1health subscribers roundrobinwebserver interval 20 Client subscription configuration To configure Sensu client subscriptions for a client please refer to the client subscriptions attribute reference documentation15 In addition to the subscriptions defined in the client configuration Sensu clients also subscribe automatically to a subscription matching their client name For example a client named i424242 will subscribe to check requests for the subscription clienti424242 This makes it possible to generate adhoc check requests targeting specific clients via the request API49 Client socket input What is the Sensu client socket Every Sensu client has a TCP UDP and HTTP socket listening for external check result input The Sensu client sockets listen by default on localhost port 3030 for TCPUDP and 3031 for HTTP and expect JSON formatted check results allowing external sources eg your web application backup scripts etc to push check results without needing to know anything about Sensus internal implementation An excellent client socket use case example is a web application pushing check results to indicate database connectivity issues To configure the Sensu client socket for a client please refer to the client socket attributes16 HTTP Socket The HTTP socket just like the TCP and UDP sockets accepts check results but it requires a wellformed HTTP request and exposes other functionality that is not possible with the raw TCPUDP sockets In exchange for a bit more complexity the HTTP socket interface has the advantage of being more expressive than a raw TCPUDP socket both in the requests that it accepts and how it responds and so exposes more functionality The following endpoints are available for the HTTP socket GET info This endpoint returns 200 OK with some basic Sensu information like the version and transport metrics POST results This endpoint expects an applicationjson body with a check result GET settings This endpoint responds with 200 OK and the sensu configuration Due to the possible sensitive nature of the client settings eg passwords might be in the config this endpoint is protected using HTTP basic authentication and by default the information returned is redacted eg common config keys like password have their values replaced by REDACTED See the redact configuration option if you need control over what is redacted This endpoint accepts the optional query string redactedfalse to disable redaction Refer to the http client socket attributes50 for details on configuring the HTTP basic authentication details that this endpoint requires GET brew This endpoint gets you some fresh coffee Try it Any requests for unknown endpoints will get a 404 with some help information in the body At the moment only unsecure HTTP no HTTPS is supported To configure the Sensu HTTP client socket please refer to the http client socket attributes50 Example client socket usage The following is an example demonstrating external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket The example uses Bashs builtin devtcp file to communicate with the Sensu client socket echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 devtcplocalhost3030 Netcat17 can also be used instead of the TCP file echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 You can do the same using the HTTP socket curl v H ContentType applicationjson X POST d name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 localhost 3031 Creating a dead mans switch The Sensu client sockets in combination with check TTLs can be used to create whats commonly referred to as dead mans switches Outside of the software industry a dead mans switch is a switch that is automatically triggered if a human operator becomes incapacitated source Wikipedia18 Sensu is more interested in detecting silent failures than incapacited human operators By using Check TTLs Sensu is able to set an expectation that a Sensu client will continue to publish results for a check at a regular interval If a Sensu client fails to publish a check result and the check TTL expires Sensu will create an event to indicate the silent failure For more information on check TTLs please refer to the check attributes reference documentation14 A great use case for the Sensu client socket is to create a dead mans switch for backup scripts to ensure they continue to run successfully at regular intervals If an external source sends a Sensu check result with a check TTL to the Sensu client socket Sensu will expect another check result from the same external source before the TTL expires The following is an example of external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket using a check TTL to create a dead mans switch for MySQL backups The example uses a check TTL of 25200 seconds or 7 hours A MySQL backup script using the following code would be expected to continue to send a check result at least once every 7 hours or Sensu will create an event7 to indicate the silent failure echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output backed up mysql successfully sizemb568 status 0 nc localhost 3030 echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output failed to backup mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 Standalone check execution scheduler In addition to subscribing to client subscriptions3 and executing check requests published by the Sensu server19 the Sensu client is able to maintain its ownseparate schedule for standalone checks20 Because the Sensu client shares the same check scheduling algorithm21 as the Sensu server it is not only possible to have consistency between subscription checks22 and standalone checks mdash its also possible to maintain consistency between standalone checks across an entire infrastructure assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP23 Client configuration Example client definition The following is an example Sensu client definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdclientjson This client definition provides Sensu with information about the system on which it resides This is a production system running a web server and a MySQL database The client name attribute is required in the definition and must be unique client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver mysql socket bind 127001 port 3030 Client

the Sensu platform is located at etcsensuconfigjson However Sensu also provides support for loading configuration from a directory containing multipledisparate configuration files andor environment variables Sensu merges configuration parameters provided from these three distinct configuration sources environment variables configuration file and configuration directories into a single Hash This type of Hash merging is often called deep merging and is probably the most important concept to understand when learning how to configure Sensu Configuration load order As previously mentioned Sensu configuration can be provided via three distinct sources environment variables a configuration file and one or more directories containing configuration files Sensu loads configuration from these sources in the following order 1 The Sensu service scripts provide command line arguments1 for starting the Sensu services eg the location of the configuration file c the location of configuration directories d etc 2 Sensu will load configuration from environment variables2 3 Sensu loads configuration from the configuration file by default this is located at etcsensuconfigjson 3 Sensu loads configuration snippets from configuration files located in a Sensu configuration directory by default this is etcsensuconfd however it is possible to configure Sensu to load from multiple configuration directories see command line arguments1 below NOTE configuration file load order is dictated by a json glob of the configuration directory as such it is strongly recommended to avoid a dependency on configuration directory file load order eg if youre attempting to name configuration files in the configuration directory to control load order youre doing it wrong Configuration merging configurationmerging To explain how Sensu merges configuration parameters from the various disparate configuration sources please note the following example scenario 1 The Sensu runtime configuration is stored as an inmemory Hash object For the purposes of providing a visual example lets imagine that this Hash object is actually a JSON document which begins life as Sensu is started as an empty JSON document Initial Sensu configuration Hash in memory When Sensu is started it will begin to collect configuration from environment variables a configuration file and one ore more configuration directories which configuration parameters will be used to build up this configuration Hash 2 For the purposes of this example lets assume that the first configuration snippet that Sensu encounters is a configuration file located at etcsensuconfigjson with the following contents New config file on disk at etcsensuconfigjson rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host 100120 port 6379 password secret At this time the Sensu configuration Hash in memory will look like Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host localhost vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret 3 Now lets see what happens when Sensu encounters another configuration snippet eg a file located in a Sensu configuration directory such as etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson New config file contents on disk at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson rabbitmq host 100110 user sensu01 password newsecret The second configuration snippet provided configuration for the rabbitmq scope some of which already exists in the Sensu configuration Hash in memory but also missing some attributes which already exist in the Sensu configuration Hash ie vhost The result of merging this configuration snippet into the Sensu configuration Hash in memory is as follows Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu01 password newsecret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret The result of the deep merge is that the configuration snippet provided by etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson was overlaid on the Sensu configuration Hash in memory essentially overwriting the previously existing values provided by the configuration snippet while not discarding configuration attributes that already existed in the rabbitmq configuration scope even though they werent provided by the configuration snippet Configuration logging As configuration snippets are applied to the Sensu configuration Hash ie during deep merge all configuration changes are logged to the corresponding log file eg the Sensu server API or Client logs Configuration scopes Because Sensu configuration can be provided in so many different sources it is important to understand that ndash regardless of the physical location of the configuration data eg from the main configuration file or from a configuration file in a configuration directory ndash all configuration must be placed in the appropriate scope in the JSON file ie the named level that attributes should be defined in For example the root or scope of the Sensu configuration would be any attributes defined at the top level of a JSON configuration file such as the configuration attributes for rabbitmq redis or the api rabbitmq redis api Attributes defined in the root scope or top level provide the corresponding scopes for additional configuration settings eg the rabbitmq attribute defined above provides the rabbitmq scope a JSON Hash for the actual RabbitMQ configuration settings Configuration scopes are relative Throughout the Sensu documentation whenever a configuration scope is mentioned it is describing the named level that the corresponding configuration attributes should be defined within which may be relative to any potentially related scopes Please note the following examples Configuration scope examples The client scope client In the Sensu Client reference documentation3 it explains that The client definition uses the client definition scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu client configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client client The client socket scope socket The Sensu Client reference documentation3 continues to explain that Sensu clients may have a socket attribute and that there are additional Client Socket attributes4 which should be defined within the socket scope The following attributes are configured within the socket client definition attribute scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu Client Socket configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client and another attribute defined within the client scope or level called socket client socket Thus when the Client Socket reference documentation continues to explain that the bind and port attributes should be defined in the Client Socket scope it means they should live under the socket level of the JSON file regardless of where you might store a configuration file containing said configuration attributes on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu client socket bind 0000 port 3031 Sensu service service configuration sensuservicescriptconfiguration The Sensu services are managed by service scripts that are provided in the Sensu packages The

extensions execute directly inside the EventMachine reactor thread1 of a Sensu client or server process Because they avoid the overhead of spawning a new process at every invocation Sensu extensions can fulfill the same functions as plugins acting as checks filters mutators or handlers but with much greater efficiency WARNING While their performance characteristics are quite desirable Sensu extensions come with major caveats extensions have full access to Sensus internals and any extension which blocks the EventMachine reactor for any period of time eg blocking on disk IO or network

loaded from the directory specified by the extensiondir flag provided when Sensu processes are started8 On most systems this defaults to etcsensuextensions as specified by the command flags passed to the sensuclient or sensuserver process via the service supervision scheme in use eg init runit upstart systemd etc Extensions should be installed directly into the extensions directory When an legacy extension has dependencies on thirdparty Ruby gems or other external applications those dependencies must be installed into the Sensu embedded Ruby environment as well Configuring Sensu Extensions The configurability of Sensu extensions is entirely a function of the extension code For example filters and mutators cannot be applied to an extension via a standard handler definition Instead these aspects of the extensions configuration must be defined in code by overriding the SensuExtensionBase definition method10 EXAMPLE extensionconfigurationincodeexample def definition type extension name name filters occurrences mutator onlycheckoutput end The above code would configure the associated extension to apply the occurrences filter and then the onlycheckoutput mutator prior to executing the extensions custom run method By virtue of being loaded into the Sensu client or server process Sensu extensions have access to the running Sensu configuration As such an extension can make use of any available configuration scopes9 but the prevailing convention is for extensions to use unique toplevel configuration scopes The systemprofile4 extension installed in a previous example looks to the toplevel systemprofile configuration scope The following configuration added to etcsensuconfd would change the systemprofile extensions Graphite path prefix from a default value of system to profile EXAMPLE providingextensionconfigurationexample systemprofile pathprefix profile The sensuextension gem Unlike Sensu plugins which may be written in any programming language Sensu extensions must be written in Ruby The sensuextension5 gem provides SensuExtensionBase and other classes which Sensu extensions should subclass The sensuextensions gem template The sensuextensions gem template12 provides a starting point for those who wish to author their own Sensu extension as a Ruby gem It is recommended that your gem follow the naming pattern sensuextensionNAME in order to ensure it can be easily installed with sensuinstall NOTE if you choose not to use this template for your extension note the directory structure it demonstrates eg placing extension code under libsensuextensions are required to ensure the extension is properly loaded Example extensions For simple examples of Sensu extensions consider the onlycheckoutput mutator6 or the debug handler7 both of which ship with Sensu

attributeswhenattributes What are Sensu filters Sensu Filters also called Event Filters allow you to filter events destined for one or more event Handlers1 Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keysvalues with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter recurring events ie to eliminate notification noise and to filter events from systems in preproduction environments When to use a filter Sensu Filters allow you to configure conditional logic to be applied during the event processing flow Compared to executing an event handler evaluating event filters is an inexpensive operation which can provide overall monitoring performance gains by reducing the number of events that need to be handled Additionally by using Sensu Filters instead of building conditional logic into custom Handlers conditional logic can be applied to multiple Handlers and monitoring configuration stays DRY How do Sensu filters work Sensu Filters are applied when Event Handlers1 are configured to use one or more Filters Prior to executing a Handler the Sensu server will apply any Filters configured for the Handler to the Event Data If the Event is not removed by the Filters ie filtered out the Handler will be executed The filter analysis flow performs these steps When the Sensu server is processing an Event it will check for the definition of a handler or handlers Prior to executing each Handler the Sensu server will first apply any configured filter or filters for the Handler If multiple filters are configured for a Handler they are executed sequentially Filter attributes are compared with Event data Filters can be inclusive only matching events are handled or exclusive matching events are not handled As soon as a Filter removes an Event ie filters it out no further analysis is performed and the Event Handler will not be executed NOTE Filters specified in a handler set16 definition have no effect Filters must be specified in individual handler definitions Inclusive and Exclusive Filtering Filters can be inclusive negate false or exclusive negate true Configuring a handler to use multiple inclusive filters is the equivalent of using an AND query operator ie only handle events if they match inclusive filters x AND y AND z Configuring a handler to use multiple exclusive filters is the equivalent of using an OR operator ie only handle events if they dont match x OR y OR z Inclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate false only events that match the defined filter attributes are handled Exclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate true events are only handled if they do not match the defined filter attributes NOTE unless otherwise configured in the filter definition2 the default filtering behavior is inclusive filtering ie negate false Filter attribute comparison Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data3 counterparts For inclusive filter definitions4 ie negate false matching attributes will result in the filter returning a true value for exclusive filter definitions4 ie negate true matching attributes will result in the filter returning a false value ie the event does not pass through the filter Filters that return a true value will continue to be processed mdash via additional filters if defined mutators if defined and handlers EXAMPLE The following example filter definition entitled productionfilter will match event data3 with a custom client definition attribute5 environment production filters productionfilter negate false attributes client environment production Filter attribute evaluation When more complex conditional logic is needed than direct filter attribute comparison10 Sensu filters provide support for attribute evaluation using Ruby expressions When a Filter attribute value is a string beginning with eval the remainder is evaluated as a Ruby expression The Ruby expression is evaluated in a sandbox and provided a single variable value which is equal to the event data attribute value being compared If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match Example Handling state change only Some teams migrating to Sensu have asked about reproducing the behavior of their old monitoring system which alerts only on state change This statechangeonly inclusive4 filter provides such filters statechangeonly negate false attributes occurrences eval value 1 action resolve This eval filter is effective because value of event occurrences is reset on each state change except when the event action is resolve The resolve action is set on an event when its check result status is 0 following one or more prior nonzero statuses Example Handling repeated events The following example filter definition entitled filterinterval60hourly will match event data3 with a check interval6 of 60 seconds and an occurrences value of 1 ie the first occurrence OR any occurrences value that is evenly divisible by 60 via a modulo operator7 calculation ie calculating the remainder after dividing occurrences by 60 Note that negate is true making this an exclusive filter4 if evaluation returns false the event will be handled filters filterinterval60hourly negate true attributes check interval 60 occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 The next example will apply the same logic as the previous example but for checks with a 30 second interval filters filterinterval30hourly negate true attributes check interval 30 occurrences eval value 1 value 120 0 NOTE The effect of both of these filters is that they will only allow an events with 30second or 60second intervals to be handled1 on the first occurrence of the event and again every hour Previous examples in the older Sensu docs have not included the check interval 60 attribute which has confused some users because filtering based on occurrences alone assumes some understanding of the relationship between occurrences and interval which isnt always obvious Example Handling events during office hours only This filter evaluates the event timestamp to determine if the event occurred between 9 AM and 5 PM on a weekday Remember that negate defaults to false so this is an inclusive filter If evaluation returns false the event will not be filters ninetofiver negate false attributes timestamp eval 12345includeTimeatvaluewday Timeatvaluehourbetween917 Filter attribute eval tokens What are filter attribute eval tokens Sensu filters attributes may be evaluated using Ruby expressions10 which evaluations provide support for comparing a single event attribute variable against a basic logical statement eg is value greater than 60 When additional variables are needed beyond the single value variable provided by eval tokens may be used Eval tokens are filter attribute placeholders that can be replaced by Sensu check definition attributes6 and client definition attributes8 including custom attributes Example filter attribute eval token The following is an example Sensu filter definition2 which is using a token checkoccurrences60 as a secondary attribute in the Ruby eval expression The token will be replaced by the check definition attribute6 named occurrences if it is defined otherwise it will use the fallback value of 60 filters occurrences negate true attributes occurrences eval value checkoccurrences60 This example would be useful for filtering events that dont exceed a minimum number of occurrences as configured in the check definition Filter attribute eval token specification Eval token substitution syntax Eval tokens are invoked by wrapping event data attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters before and after the attribute ie Nested event data attributes3 may be accessed via dot notation eg checkoccurrences occurrences would be replaced with the event occurrences data11 checkmythreshold would be replaced with a custom check definition attribute12 called mythreshold Eval token default values Eval token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an eval token attribute13 is not satisfied by event data3 Eval token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for events that are missing the declared token attribute checkoccurrences60 would be replaced with a check definition attribute6 called occurrences If occurrences is not defined in the check definition the default or fallback value of 60 will be used NOTE if an eval token default value is not provided ie as a fallback value and the event data does not contain a matching eval token attribute13 an log entry indicating an error called filter eval unmatched tokens will be published to the Sensu server log Filter configuration Example filter definition examplefilterdefinition The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This is an inclusive filter definition called production The effect of this filter is that only events with the custom client attribute5 environment production will be handled filters production attributes client environment production negate false Filter definition specification Filter naming Each filter definition has a unique name used for the definition key

email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty ServiceNow etc or storing metrics in a timeseries database eg Graphite Handler types There are several types of handlers The most common handler type is the pipe handler which works very similarly to how checks3 work enabling Sensu to interact with almost any computer program via standard streams4 Pipe handlers Pipe handlers pipe event data into arbitrary commands via STDIN TCPUDP handlers TCP and UDP handlers send event data to a remote socket eg external API Transport handlers Transport handlers publish event data to the Sensu transport5 Handler sets Handler sets also called set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easy to manage groups of actions that should be executed for certain types of events The default handler Sensu expects all events2 to have a corresponding handler Event handlers may be configured in check definitions16 however if no handler or handlers have been configured Sensu will attempt to handle the event using a handler named15 default The default handler is only a reference ie Sensu does not provide a builtin default handler so if no handler definition exists for a handler named default Sensu will log an error indicating that the event was not handled because a default handler definition does not exist To use one or more existing handlers as the default you can create a Set handler17 called default and include the existing handlers in the set Pipe handlers Pipe handlers are external commands that can consume event data6 via STDIN Example pipe handler definition handlers examplepipehandler type pipe command dosomethingawesomerb o options Pipe handler commands What is a pipe handler command Pipe handler definitions include a command attribute which are

above all pipe handlers are executed by a Sensu server1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu server system ie installed in a system PATH directory7 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command handlerircrb TCPUDP handlers tcpudphandlers TCP and UDP handlers enable Sensu to forward event data to arbitrary TCP or UDP socketst for external services to consume eg thirdparty APIs Example TCP handler definition The following example TCP handler definition will forward event data6 to a TCP socket8 ie 1001994444 and will timeout if an acknowledgement ACK is not received within 30 seconds handlers exampletcphandler type tcp timeout 30 socket host 100199 port 4444 The following example UDP

event data to named queues on the Sensu transport5 for external services to consume Example transport handler definition The following example transport handler definition will publish event data6 to the Sensu transport on a pipe eg a queue or channel etc named examplehandlerqueue One or more instances of an external process or thirdparty application would need to subscribe to the named pipe to process the events handlers exampletransporthandler type transport pipe type direct name examplehandlerqueue Handler sets Handler set definitions allow groups of handlers ie individual collections of actions to take on event data to be referenced via a single named handler set NOTE Attributes defined on handler sets do not apply to the handlers they include For example filter filters and mutator

failure When to use a mutator Many Sensu event handlers2 will modify event data1 in the course of processing an event9 and in many cases this is recommended because modifying the event data and performing some action in memory in the same process will result in better performance than executing a mutator5 and a handler two separate processes However when multiple handlers require similar event data modifications mutators provide the ability to avoid code duplication DRY and simplify event handler logic How do Sensu mutators work Sensu mutators are applied when event handlers2 are

What is the Sensu server The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests1 to client subscriptions2 via a PublishSubscribe model3 and provides a scalable event processing platform4 for processing check results and monitoring events Sensu Core vs Sensu Enterprise The Sensu server comes in two flavors the opensource Sensu Core5 via the sensuserver process and Sensu Enterprise6 via the sensuenterprise process To learn more about the differences between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise please visit the Sensu website7 NOTE Sensu Enterprise ie the sensuenterprise process was designed to be a dropin replacement for the Sensu Core server and API ie the sensuserver and sensuapi As such any mention of the Sensu server in the Sensu documentation also applies to the sensuenterprise process for Sensu Enterprise users WARNING as noted above the sensuenterprise process is designed to replace both of the Sensu Core sensuserver and sensuapi processes Because Sensu Enterprise will load the same configuration as Sensu Core it is important that the Sensu Core processes are stopped before starting Sensu Enterprise to avoid known conflicts and processing errors such as attempting to bind on the same ports etc Check execution scheduling Check execution scheduling is performed by a Sensu server see Sensu server task election8 Checks are scheduled by querying Sensus configuration for defined checks ndash excluding check with the attributes standalone true or publish false ndash and calculating when executions should occur based on their defined intervals Check scheduling algorithm synchronization checkschedulingalgorithmsynchronization Sensu uses an internal algorithm for determining a unique cadence for Sensu checks which uniqueness is based on the check name and interval This algorithm outputs a value in milliseconds which the Sensu server will use as an offset before the next check request should be published In practice this means that ndash assuming system clocks are in sync between disparate Sensu servers ndash check requests for a given check based on the check name will be published at the exact same time The also means that in the event of a Sensu server restart andor Sensu server task reelection ie if a new Sensu server is elected to become reponsible for check execution scheduling check execution scheduling intervals will remain consistent In fact because this algorithm is also shared by the Sensu client ndash which provides decentralized check execution scheduling in the form of standalone checks22 ndash a check defined on the Sensu server and a matching standalone check defined on a Sensu client should also stay in sync with each other again assuming that system clocks are in sync and the check names and intervals are consistent Event processing The Sensu server provides a scalable event processor Event processing involves conversion of check results9 into Sensu events and then applying any defined event filters10 event data mutators11 and event handlers12 All event processing happens on a Sensu server system The event processing workflow happens in the following order Event Filter Mutator Handler NOTE events that are filtered out ie removed by Sensu event filtersfilters will not continue to be mutated by event data mutatorsmutators or event handlershandlers Sensus event processing capabilities can be distributed among multiple Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster For more information on configuring a Sensu cluster please see Scaling Sensu13 below Automated task election The Sensu server processes ie sensuserver and sensuenterprise are designed to scale horizontally14 ie by adding systems No additional configuration is required to run a cluster of Sensu servers other than the location of the transport15 and data store16 When Sensu servers start they participate in an election process to automatically distribute tasks A Sensu server may be elected for more than one task A server task can only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart All Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster monitor the state of task execution on a 10second interval automatically electing a new Sensu server for a task if the current one hasnt confirmed execution in more than 30 seconds Server tasks In a Sensu server cluster responsibility for a distinct set of tasks is distributed amongst members of the cluster The tasks only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart When adding Sensu servers to a cluster restarting the existing Sensu servers in the cluster will force a redistribution of tasks Check request

Deleting silencing entriesdeletingsilencingentries Appendix Deprecated stashbased silencingappendixdeprecatedstashbasedsilencing Comparing stashbased and native silencingcomparingstashbasedandnativesilencing Migrating from stashbased silencingmigratingfromstashbasedsilencing What is Sensu Silencing As check results0 are processed by a Sensu server the server executes event handlers1 to send alerts to personnel or otherwise relay event data to external services Although event handlers can be directly configured with filters11 to improve overall signaltonoise ratio there are many scenarios in which operators receiving notifications from Sensu require an ondemand means to suppress alerts Sensus builtin silencing provides the means to suppress execution of event handlers on an adhoc basis By using a dashboard or other tool to interact with the silenced API2 operators can mute notifications onthefly The silenced API manipulates silencing entries in the Sensu data store These entries describe a combination of check name and subscription When the check name3 andor subscription4 described in a silencing entry match an event the handler will not be executed and an informational message will be logged Individual handlers may optout of silencing by configuring the handlesilenced attribute5 NOTE Silencing described in this reference document is implemented in Sensu version 026 or later and Sensu Enterprise 20 or later When to use silencing Silencing is used to prevent handlers from being triggered based on the check name present in a check result or the subscriptions associated with the client that published the check result This can be desirable in many scenarios giving operators the ability to quiet incoming alerts while coordinating their response Sensu silencing entries make it possible to Silence all checks on a specific clientsilenceallchecksonaspecificclient Silence a specific check on a specific clientsilenceaspecificcheckonaspecificclient Silence all checks on clients with a specific subscriptionsilenceallchecksonclientswithaspecificsubscription Silence a specific check on clients with a

above combinations silencing entries support Expiration after a specified number of seconds Expiration after check returns to OK state resolves Describing the reason or rationale Describing the creator or entity responsible for an entry How does silencing work Silencing entries are created on an adhoc basis via the silenced API2 endpoint When silencing entries are successfully created via the API they are assigned an ID in the format SUBSCRIPTIONCHECK where SUBSCRIPTION is the name of a Sensu client subscription and CHECK is the name of a Sensu check Silencing entries can be used to silence checks on specific clients by by taking advantage of perclient subscriptions4 added in Sensu 026 eg clientCLIENTNAME These silencing entries are persisted to the silenced registry in the Sensu data store10 When the Sensu server processes subsequent check results it consults this registry to determine whether or not a matching silencing entry exists If one or more matching entries exist in the registry the event context for the check result is updated to indicate that the event is silenced and the ID of the entries which the check result matched When creating a silencing entry a combination of check and subscription can be specified but only one or the other is strictly required For example when a silencing entry is created specifying only a check its ID will contain an asterisk or wildcard in the SUBSCRIPTION position This indicates that any event with a matching check name will be marked as silenced regardless of the originating clients subscriptions Conversely a silencing entry which specifies only a subscription will have an ID with an asterisk in the CHECK position This indicates that any event where the originating clients subscriptions match the subscription specified in the entry will be marked as silenced regardless of the check name NOTE Starting with version 026 Sensu clients automatically add a subscription containing their client name prefixed with the string client For example client i424242 will automatically add subscription clienti424242 Silencing checks at the individual client level requires clients to run Sensu 026 or be manually configured with a client subscription Silencing entry specification Silencing entries are composed as a JSON document containing at least one of the required subscription or check attributes and additional optional attributes as desired Silencing entries are created updated and deleted by submitting JSON documents to endpoints on the silenced API2 via HTTP POST as shown in the examples

to connect to RabbitMQ on port 5671 3 Restart the Sensu services Known limitations You may have noticed that the instructions above only generated a single client certificate Ideally every SSL connection would use a different certificate allowing them to be individually revoked There is currently no way to tell RabbitMQ to reject a certificate If the integrity of a certificate is compromised it is common practice to regenerate and redistribute the certificate authority and certificates This process is greatly simplified with the use of configuration management tools In the future the Sensu project hopes to be able to provide a better mechanism for distributing individual certificates and providing fastsimple revocation facilities 1 transport 2 httpwwwrabbitmqcomsslhtml

library makes it possible to replace Sensus recommended and default transport RabbitMQ with alternative solutions There are currently two 2 transports provided with the sensutransport library RabbitMQ

improvements CHANGES corev110changes IMPORTANT Sensu packages include Ruby 241 Upgrading from releases of Sensu prior to 100 will require all plugin or extension gems to be reinstalled under the new Ruby environment IMPORTANT Sensu packages include sensuplugin 20050 which disables its deprecated filter methods by default ie occurrences Sensu releases since 100 include builtin filters that provide the same functionality with several improvements The builtin filters are occurrences51 and checkdependencies52 To use the builtin filters apply them to Sensu event handlers via their definition filters attribute eg filters occurrences checkdependencies These filters can now be used with Sensu event handlers that do not use the sensuplugin library or Ruby NEW Check hooks commands run by the Sensu client in response to the result of the check command execution The Sensu client will execute the appropriate configured hook command depending on the check execution status eg 1 Valid hook names include in order of precedence 1255 ok warning critical unknown and nonzero The check hook command output status executed timestamp and duration are captured and published in the check result Check hook commands can optionally receive JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data via STDIN NEW Check STDIN A boolean check definition attribute stdin when set to true instructs the Sensu client to write JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data to the check command process STDIN This attribute cannot be used with existing Sensu check plugins nor Nagios plugins etc as the Sensu client will wait indefinitely for the check process to read and close STDIN IMPROVEMENT Splayed proxy check request publishing Users can now splay proxy check requests optional evenly over a window of time determined by the check interval and a configurable splay coverage percentage For example if a check has an interval of 60s and a configured splay coverage of 90 its proxy check requests would be splayed evenly over a time window of 60s 90 54s leaving 6s for the last proxy check execution before the the next round of proxy check requests for the same check Proxy check request splayed publishing can be configured with two new check definition attributes within the proxyrequests scope splay boolean to enable it and splaycoverage integer percentage defaults to 90 IMPROVEMENT Configurable check output truncation for storage in Redis Check output truncation can be manually enableddisabled with the check definition attribute truncateoutput egtruncateoutput false The output

Sensu please consider giving Sensu Enterprisehttpssensuapporggetstarted a try Do I need RabbitMQ to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq as a Transportreferencetransport Sensu services require access to a shared instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscription topics Does Redis need to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses Redisreferenceredis as a data store and the Sensu server services ie sensuserver sensuapi for Sensu Core sensuenterprise for Sensu Enterprise require access to the same Redis instance or cluster to store and access the Sensu client registry check results check execution history and current event data Do check definitions need to exist on every system I wish to monitor No Check definitions can be written as publishsubscribe pubsub or standalone Pubsub checks which specify a list of subscribers need only be configured on the Sensu server Standalone checks which are scheduled and executed by the Sensu client need only be configured on the clients where they should be run Where should check plugin executables be installed Regardless of where checks are defined the actual check executables need to exist on the filesystem for the Sensu client to execute them Check plugin executables can be installed in etcsensuplugins or optsensuembeddedbin the latter being the location where plugin executables are installed via sensuinstall What is a standalone check A standalone check is a check definition that is installed on and executed by the Sensu client without being scheduled by the Sensu server Standalone checks defer Check execution scheduling responsibilitiesoverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler to Sensu clients enabling decentralized management of monitoring checks and distribution of scheduling responsibilities Standalone checks may be used in conjunction with pubsub checks and are distinguished from pubsub checks by inclusion of the standalone true configuration parameter What happens if a single check is defined on both the Sensu server and client When a check request is published for a check defined on the Sensu server the Sensu client will look for a local definition matching the check name prior to executing the check If a local definition exists it is mergedreferenceconfigurationconfigurationmerging with the definition provided by the server with any local definition attributes overriding the definition provided by the Sensu server What is Sensu Client safemode In safemode a client will not run a check published by a Sensu server unless that check is also defined on the client Safe mode must be enabled on the Sensu Client via the safemode configuration attribute Can multiple Sensu servers be run

a centralized Check Execution Scheduleroverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler automated failover automatically electing a new leader if the previous leader is unexpectedly unavailable and distributed event processing check results are distributed across all Sensu servers in a roundrobin fashion Running more than one Sensu server is highly recommended for performance and availability

RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq see Sensu Configurationreferenceconfigurationtoplevelconfigurationscopes and some minimal client configuration eg a name address and one or more subscriptions in order to start When the Sensu client process starts it begins sending keepalives ndash a special type of check result containing client configuration data ndash which the Sensu server uses to know that a client is still connected When a client keepalive is received for a client name that is not currently registered with Sensu the client is added to the registry and a registration event is created automatically Do system clocks need to be synchronized Yes The Sensu services ie sensuclient sensuserver sensuapi sensuenterprise use the localsystem clock for generating timestamps When system clocks

Core","version":"1.1","location":"/sensu-core/1.1/guides/adding-a-client","display_name":"Sensu Core 1.1: Adding a Client","content":"Sensu clients are pieces of infrastructure that Sensu monitors for you The Sensu client software allows you to register a running instance of itself as capable of running any checks they might be eligible for Infrastructure sometimes includes hardware or services that dont necessarily support running the Sensu client software but still needs to be monitored For those cases proxy clientsproxyclients let you monitor anything you can tell Sensu about Adding a Sensu Client One of the first challenges new Sensu users often encounter is learning what is required to get a remote Sensu client1 to communicate with the Sensu server2 If youre in a hurry skip ahead to add a remote Sensu client3 for stepbystep instructions Alternatively once you understand the two requirements for adding Sensu clients youll know everything you need to start deploying Sensu clients to your entire infrastructure Please continue reading to learn how adding Sensu clients starts with configuration4 and is ultimately all about the transport5 It starts with configuration Sensu is designed to be operated via configuration This core philosophy is what enables Sensu to work so seamlessly with modern automation solutions and configuration management platforms To learn more about how Sensu is configured please consult the Sensu configuration reference documentation6 The Sensu client requires a minimal amount of configuration to enable it to automatically register itself7 with the Sensu server which configuration includes a client definition8 eg the client name address and subscriptions and a transport definition9 Its all about the transport The Sensu processes use a transport10 a message bus for communication By default this is RabbitMQ11 but modern versions of Sensu have added support for alternative transports12 including Redis13 Without a transport connection a Sensu client will be unable to send monitoring data eg keepalive messages14 check results15 etc In order to connect to the transport the Sensu client will need three pieces of information Which transport to use this tells Sensu which transport library should it load and which configuration scope should it use to obtain connection details A valid transport definition this provides Sensu with an IP address or hostname and any security credentials needed to connect to the transport Network access to the transport socket ie the Sensu client will need outbound network access and the transport will need to be configured to listen for remote network connections Add a remote Sensu client With the exception of Sensu clients that are running on the Sensu server which is very useful and strongly recommended all Sensu clients are essentially remote clients as they have to establish network communication to send monitoring data eg client keepalives14 and check results15 Please note the following steps that are required to add a remote Sensu client 1 Configure the client Create a client definition located at etcsensuconfdclientjson with the following contents replacing the values for the client name address and subscriptions with the corresponding values for the client you are adding client name i041256 address 8888 subscriptions default webserver 2 Tell the client which transport to use Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdtransportjson with the following contents replacing the value for the transport name with the corresponding value for the transport you are using eg use transport redis if you are using the Redis transport transport name rabbitmq reconnectonerror true 3 Tell the client how to connect to the transport Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson or etcsensuconfdredisjson if you are using the Redis transport NOTE please consult the corresponding reference documentation for RabbitMQ11 or Redis13 for more configuration examples and detailed information on how to configure Sensus connection 4 Start the client Start the Sensu client and verify connectivity by consulting the Sensu client log file NOTE The service command will not work on CentOS 5 the sysvinit script must be used eg sudo etcinitdsensuclient start sudo service sensuclient start Proxy Clients Sometimes a logical piece of infrastructure isnt a device we can run Sensu on Fundamentally Sensu gives you the flexibility to separate how checks run from where they run which lets you monitor arbitrary named black box devices or services For example you may have a router that you cant run Sensu on but publishes interesting information over SNMP that you want to gather metrics from Or maybe your monitor which other datacenters are visibleonline to you or have any number of creative use cases You can create a proxy client16 that can have attributes for use in check execution allowing you to use the client registry naturally for managed an unmanaged infrastructure See the reference for creating proxy clients16 or details on writing checks against them17 for more Troubleshooting 1 referenceclients 2 referenceserver 3

in this guide Creation of standard checks functional tests Creation of metric collection checks server resources etc Creation of metric analysis checks querying time series data etc What are Sensu checks whataresensuchecks Sensu checks allow you to monitor server resources services and application health as well as collect analyze metrics they are executed on servers running the Sensu client Checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state The common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Create a standard check Standard Sensu checks are used to determine the health of server resources services and applications A standard check will query a resource for information to determine its state Once a standard check has determined the resource state it outputs a human readable message and exits with the appropriate exit status code to indicate its stateseverity OK WARNING etc Monitor the cron service The following instructions install the check dependencies and configure the Sensu check definition in order to monitor the Cron service Install dependencies checkcroninstalldependencies The checkprocessrb script provided by the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 can reliably detect if a service such as Cron is running or not The following instructions will install the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkprocessrb script sudo sensuinstall p processchecks006 Create the check definition for Cron The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcheckcronjson This check definition uses the checkprocessrb script installed above3 to determine if the Cron service is running The check is named cron and it runs checkprocessrb p cron on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 60 seconds interval NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron subscribers production interval 60 For a full listing of the checkprocessrb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbincheckprocessrb h Currently the Cron check definition requires that check requests be sent to Sensu clients with the production subscription This is known as pubsub check Optionally a check may use standalone mode which allows clients to schedule their own check executions The following is an example of the Cron check using standalone mode true The Cron check will now be executed every 60 seconds on each Sensu client with the check definition A Sensu check definition with standalone true does not need to specify subscribers checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 By default Sensu checks use the default Sensu event handler for events they create To specify a different Sensu event handler for a check use the handler attribute The debug event handler used in this example will log the Sensu event data to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 handler debug Using multiple handlers To specify multiple Sensu event handlers use the handlers attribute plural NOTE if both handler and handlers plural check definition attributes are used handlers will take precedence checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron

collection checks can output metric data in a variety of metric formats Graphite plaintext4 Nagios Performance Data5 OpenTSDB6 Metrics 20 wire format7 Measuring CPU utilization Install dependencies cpumetricsinstalldependencies The metricscpurb script provided by the Sensu CPU Checks Plugin8 collects and outputs CPU metrics in the Graphite plaintext format The following instructions will install

example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcpumetricsjson This check definition uses the metricscpurb script installed above9 to collect CPU metrics and output them in the Graphite plaintext format By default Sensu checks with an exit status code of 0 for OK do not create events unless they indicate a change in state from a nonzero status to a zero status ie resulting in a resolve action see Sensu Events10 Metric collection checks will output metric data regardless of the check exit status code however they usually exit 0 To ensure events are always created for a metric collection check the check type of metric is used The check is named cpumetrics and it runs metricscpurb on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 10 seconds interval The debug handler is used to log the graphite plaintext CPU metrics to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cpumetrics type metric command metricscpurb subscribers production interval 10 handler debug For a full listing of the metricscpurb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbinmetricscpurb h Create a metric analysis check A metric analysis check analyzes metric data which may or may not have been collected by a metrics collection check11 By querying external metric stores eg Graphite to perform data evaluations metric analysis checks allow you to perform powerful analytics based on trends in metric data rather than a single data point For example where monitoring and alerting on a single CPU utilization data point can result in false positive events based on momentary spikes monitoring and alerting on CPU utilization data over a specified period of time will improve alerting accuracy Because metric analysis checks require interaction with an external metric store providing a functional example is outside of the scope of this guide However assuming the existence of a Graphite installation that is populated with metric data the following example checks could be used The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 The check queries Graphite for a calculated moving average using the last 10 data points of the load balancer session count The session count moving average is compared with the provided alert thresholds A Sensu client running on the Graphite server would be responsible for scheduling and executing this check standalone mode NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks sessioncount command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t movingAveragelb1assetsbackendsessioncurrent10 w 100 c 200 standalone true interval 30 The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 for disk capacity metrics The Graphite API query uses highestCurrent to grab only the highest disk capacity metric to be compared with the provided alert thresholds This check will trigger an event alert when one or more disks on any machine are at the configured capacity threshold In this example configuration the check is configured to warn at 85 capacity w 85 and to raise a critical alert at 95 capacity c 95 checks diskcapacity command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t highestCurrentdiskcapacity1 w 85 c 95 a 120 standalone true interval 30 The following instructions will install the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkgraphitedatarb script sudo sensuinstall p graphite006 Checking on Other Clients proxyclients Sensu supports running checks where the results are considered to be for a client that isnt actually the one executing the check regardless of whether that client is a Sensu client or simply a proxy client14 There are a number of reasons for this use case but fundamentally Sensu handles it the same Checks are scheduled normally but by specifying a Proxy Request13 in your check clients that match certain definitions their clientattributes cause the check to run for each one The attributes supplied must normally match exactly as stated no variables or directives have any special meaning but you can still use eval to perform more complicated filtering with Ruby on the available value such as finding clients with particular subscriptions given that were dealing with

this guide demonstrates one or more filter definition features for more information please refer to the Sensu filters reference documentation1 Objectives What will be covered in this guide Creation of an event filter Creation of an event filter with Ruby and math What are Sensu filters whataresensufilters Sensu filters allow you to filter out events destined for one or more event handlers Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keyvalues pairs with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter event recurrences to eliminate notification noise and to filter events that are not for production machines Create an event filter Inclusive filtering The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This filter definition will include events that match the filter criteria In this example the filter itself is named production which matches events with a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production Exclusive filtering To exclude events based on filter criteria set the negate filter definition attribute to true In this example the production filter will match events that do not have a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production negate true Using a filter To use the production filter for an event handler set the filter attribute in the handler definition For example handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filter production Using multiple filters To specify multiple Sensu event filters use the filters attribute plural NOTE if both filter and filters plural handler definition attributes are used filters will take precedence handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filters production operations Create an event filter with Ruby and math Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data counterparts via Ruby object comparison However it is also possible to use Ruby expressions to evaluate event data attribute values When a filter attribute value is a string that begins with eval the remainder of the string is evaluated as a Ruby expression The event data attribute value is provided to the Ruby expression as a variable entitled value If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match This Ruby expression evaluation is performed in a sandbox for safety The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterrecurrencesjson This filter excludes events that are not the first event occurrence and those that do not have an occurrence count divisible by 60 without a remainder recurrence Logically if checks with an execution interval of 1 minute are generating events every minute this filter will help reduce noise by only allowing event handling once per hour filters recurrences attributes occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 1 referencefilters"},{"title":"Intro to

execute a command and pass the event data to the corresponding process via STDIN Install dependencies The following instructions install the eventfile Sensu handler plugin written in Ruby to etcsensupluginseventfilerb This handler plugin reads the event data via STDIN parses it creates a file name using the parsed event data and then writes the event data to the file eg

RESTful APIrestfulapi Architectural Diagram Sensu Architecture Gifimagessensudiagramgif Secure Transport Sensu services use a message bus eg RabbitMQ1 to communicate with one another technically speaking the Sensu services dont actually communicate with each other they only communicate with the message bus As of Sensu Core version 013 this message bus communication in Sensu has been abstracted as the Sensu Transport2 making it possible to leverage alternate transport solutions in place of RabbitMQ the default Transport Sensu services requires access to the same instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscriptions Data Store Sensu leverages a data store3 for data persistence Only the Sensu server API and dashboard services require access to the data store mdash the Sensu client4 monitoring agent does not By storing data in Redis the Sensu services themselves can remain stateless Although Sensu is designed to route telemetry data to external timeseries

Execution Scheduler Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu server and the Sensu client monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks on the local system only Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive so monitoring checks may be configured for both of Sensus schedulers the Sensu server and Sensu client and Sensu will ensure that the corresponding checks are executed on the appropriate systems Monitoring Agent The Sensu client is a fully featured monitoring agent which provides the following features dynamic selfregistration client subscriptions for monitoring checks configured via

solution Sensu provides a framework for monitoring infrastructure service application health and business KPIs Sensu is specifically designed to solve monitoring challenges introduced by modern infrastructure platforms with a mix of static dynamic and ephemeral infrastructure at scale ie public private and hybrid clouds Sensu allows organizations to compose comprehensive monitoring telemetry solutions to meet unique business requirements By providing a platform to build upon Sensu enables you to focus on what to monitor and measure rather than how Sensu is installed on your organizations infrastructure ndash it is not a SoftwareasaService SaaS solution ndash which means Sensu gives you full control over the availability of your monitoring solution Benefits Sensu is a comprehensive infrastructure and application monitoring solution that provides the following benefits Monitor servers services application health and business KPIs Sensu is an infrastructure and application monitoring telemetry solution Send alerts and notifications Sensu integrates with the tools and services your organization is already using to do things like send emails PagerDuty1 alerts Slack2 HipChat3 IRC notifications and many4 more5 Dynamic client registration deregistration When servers are provisioned they automatically register themselves with Sensu so theres no need to manually add or configure new servers A simple yet extensible model for monitoring Sensu provides a sophisticated yet simple to understand solution for executing service checks6 and processing events7 at scale Service checks provide status and telemetry data and event handlers process results Hundreds of plugins are available for monitoring the tools and services youre already using Plugins have a very simple specification and can be written in any programming language Built for missioncritical applications and multitiered networks Sensus use of a secure transport8 protects your infrastructure from exposure and makes it possible for Sensu to traverse complex network topologies including those that use NAT and VPNs and span public networks Sensu provides a secure monitoring solution trusted by international banking institutions government agencies Fortune 100 organizations and many more Designed for automation Sensu exposes 100 of its configuration as JSON files which makes it extremely automationndashfriendly eg it was designed to work with tools like Chef9 Puppet10 and Ansible11 Open source software with commercial support Sensu is an opensource software OSS project made freely available under a permissive MIT License12 the source code is publicly available on GitHub13 Sensu Enterprise14 is based on Sensu Core the OSS version of Sensu which makes addedvalue features commercial support training and many other benefits available under the Sensu License15 A Simple Yet Powerful Framework Sensu is a comprehensive monitoring solution that is powerful enough to solve complex monitoring problems at scale yet simple enough to use for traditional monitoring scenarios and small environments It achieves this broad appeal via building upon two simple yet powerful monitoring primitives Service Checks16 and Event Processing7 These building blocks also provide an infinitely extensible framework for composing monitoring solutions What is a Service Check servicechecks Service checks allow you to monitor services eg is Nginx running or measure resources eg how much disk space do I have left Service checks are executed on machines running a monitoring agent ie Sensu client17 Service checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state Common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Service checks produce results that are processed by the event processor ie the Sensu server Learn more 17 What is Event Processing eventprocessing Event processing also called stream processing is a method of analyzing processing and storing streams of information data about things that happen events deriving a conclusion from them and potentially executing some action handling The Sensu event processor the Sensu server enables you to execute Handlers18 for taking action on events produced by service checks such as sending an email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty or ServiceNow

attributescheckresultclientattributes What is a Sensu check Sensu checks are commands executed by the Sensu client1 which monitor a condition eg is Nginx running or collect measurements eg how much disk space do I have left Although the Sensu client will attempt to execute any command defined for a check successful processing of check results requires adherence to a simple specification Sensu check specification Result data is output to STDOUT or STDERR2 For standard checks this output is typically a humanreadable message For metrics checks this output contains the measurements gathered by the check Exit status code indicates state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an UNKNOWN or custom status PRO TIP Those familiar with the Nagios3 monitoring system may recognize this specification as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins As a result Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu without any modification At every execution of a check command ndash regardless of success or failure ndash the Sensu client publishes the checks result4 for eventual handling by the event processor5 ie the Sensu server6 Check commands What is a check command Each Sensu check definition7 defines a command and the interval at which it should be executed Check commands are literally executable commands which will be executed on the Sensu client1 run as the sensu user Most check commands are provided by Sensu check plugins8 Check command arguments Sensu check command attributes may include command line arguments for controlling the behavior of the command executable Most Sensu check plugins8 provide support for command line arguments for reusability How and where are check commands executed As mentioned above all check commands are executed by Sensu clients1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu client system ie installed in a system PATH directory9 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg Check execution platform How are checks scheduled Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu serverserver and the Sensu client10 monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model11 ie subscription checkssubscriptionchecks The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks12 on the local system only Because Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive any Sensu client may be configured to both schedule and execute its own standalone checks as well as execute subscription checks scheduled by the Sensu server Subscription checks Sensu checks which are centrally defined and scheduled by the Sensu server6 are called subscription checks Sensus use of a message bus transport13 for communication enables topicbased communication14 mdash where messages are published to a specific topic and consumers subscribe to one or more specific topics This form of communication is commonly referred to as the publishsubscribe pattern11 or pubsub for short Subscription checks have a defined set of subscribers15 a list of transport13 topics14 that check requests will be published to Sensu clients become subscribers to these topics ie subscriptions via their individual client definition16 subscriptions attribute In practice subscriptions will typically correspond to a specific role andor responsibility eg a webserver database etc Subscriptions are a powerful primitives in the monitoring context because they allow you to effectively monitor for specific behaviors or characteristics corresponding to the function being provided by a particular system For example disk capacity thresholds might be more important or at least different on a database server as opposed to a webserver conversely CPU andor memory usage thresholds might be more important on a caching system than on a file server Subscriptions also allow you to configure check requests for an entire group or subgroup of systems rather than require a traditional 11 mapping Standalone checks Sensu checks which are defined on a Sensu client1 with the check definition attribute17 standalone set to true are called standalone checks The Sensu client provides its own scheduler10 for scheduling standalone checks which ensures scheduling consistency between Sensu clients with identical check definitions assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP18 Standalone checks are an important complement to subscription checks19 because they provide a decentralized management alternative for Sensu Check results What is a check result A check result is a JSON20 document published as a message on the Sensu transport13 by the Sensu client upon completion of a check execution Sensu check results include the check definition attributes17 eg command subscribers interval name etc including custom attributes21 the client name the result was submitted from and the output of the check Example check result output check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE please refer to the check result specification38 below for more information about check results Check token substitution What is check token substitution Sensu check definitions17 may include attributes that you may wish to override on a clientbyclient basis For example check commands23 ndash which may include command line arguments23 for controlling the behavior of the check command ndash may benefit from clientspecific thresholds etc Sensu check tokens are check definition placeholders that will be replaced by the Sensu client with the corresponding client definition attribute16 values including custom attributes24 NOTE Sensu check tokens were formerly known as check command tokens which limited token substitution to the check command attribute command tokens were also sometimes referred to as Sensu client overrides a reference to the fact that command tokens allowed client attributes to override check command arguments23 NOTE Check tokens are processed before check execution therefore token substitution will not apply to check data delivered via the local client socket input46 Example check tokens The following is an example Sensu check definition17 using three check tokens for check command arguments23 In this example the checkdiskusagerb command accepts w warning and c critical arguments to indicate the thresholds as percentages for creating warning or critical events As configured this check will create a warning event at 80 disk capacity unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskwarning80 and a critical event will be created if disk capacity reaches 90 unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskcritical90 This example also creates a custom check definition attribute called environment which will default to a value of production unless a different value is provided by the client definition ie environmentproduction checks checkdiskusage command checkdiskusagerb w diskwarning80 c diskcritical90 subscribers production interval 60 environment environmentproduction The following example Sensu client definition16 would provide the necessary attributes to override the diskwarning diskcritical and environment tokens declared above client name i424242 address 1002100 subscriptions production webserver mysql disk warning 75 critical 85 environment development Check token specification Token substitution syntax Check tokens are invoked by wrapping references to client attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters ie Nested Sensu client definition attributes16 can be accessed via dot notation eg diskwarning address would be replaced with the client address attribute26 url would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url diskwarning would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called warning nested inside of a JSON hash called disk Token substitution default values checktokendefaultvalues Check token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an attribute is not provided by the client definition16 Check token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for clients that are missing the declared token attribute urlhttpssensuapporg would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url If no such attribute called url is included in the client definition the default or fallback value of httpssensuapporg will be used Unmatched tokens If a token substitution default value25 is not provided ie as a fallback value and the Sensu client definition does not have a matching definition attribute a check result4 indicating unmatched tokens will be published for the check execution eg Unmatched check tokens diskwarning Check hooks What are check hooks whatarecheckhooks Check hooks are commands run by the Sensu client in response to the result of check command execution The Sensu client will execute the appropriate configured hook command depending on the check execution status eg 1 Valid hook names include in order of precedence 1255 ok warning critical unknown and nonzero The check hook command output status executed timestamp and duration are captured and published in the check result Check hook commands can optionally receive JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data via STDIN Example check hooks Check hooks can be used for automated data gathering for incident triage for example a check hook could be used to capture the process tree when a process has been determined to be not running etc checks nginxprocess command checkprocessrb p nginx subscribers proxy interval 60 hooks nonzero command ps aux Check hooks can also be used for rudimentary autoremediation tasks for example starting a process that is no longer running checks nginxprocess command checkprocessrb p nginx subscribers proxy interval 60 hooks critical command sudo systemctl start nginx Check configuration Example check definition The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdchecksensuwebsitejson This check definition uses a Sensu plugin27 named checkhttprb28 to ensure that the Sensu website is still available The check is named sensuwebsite and it runs on Sensu clients with the production subscription15 at an interval of 60 seconds checks sensuwebsite command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers production interval 60 contact ops Check definition specification Check naming checknames Each check definition has a unique check name used for the definition key Every check definition is within the checks configuration scope29 A unique string used to nameidentify the check Cannot contain special characters or spaces Validated with Ruby regex30

puppet attributespuppetattributes servicenow attributesservicenowattributes Custom attributescustomattributes What is a Sensu client Sensu clients are monitoring agents1 which are installed and run on every system eg server container etc that needs to be monitored The client is responsible for registering the system with Sensu sending client keepalive2 messages the Sensu heartbeat mechanism and executing monitoring checks Each client is a member of one or more subscriptions3 ndash a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc Sensu clients will subscribe to or watch for check requests4 published by the Sensu server5 via the Sensu Transport6 execute the corresponding requests locally and publish the results of the check back to the transport to be processed by a Sensu server Client keepalives What is a client keepalive Sensu Client keepalives are the heartbeat mechanism used by Sensu to ensure that all registered Sensu clients are still operational and able to reach the Sensu Transport6 Sensu clients publish keepalive messages containing client configuration data to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds If a Sensu client fails to send keepalive messages over a period of 120 seconds by default the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create a keepalive event7 Keepalives can be used to identify unhealthy systems and network partitions among other things and keepalive events can trigger email notifications and other useful actions Client registration the client registry registrationandregistry In practice client registrations happens when a Sensu server processes a client keepalive message for a client that is not already registered in the Sensu client registry based on the configured client name or source attribute This client registry is stored in the Sensu data store8 and is accessible via the Sensu Clients API9 All Sensu client data provided in client keepalive messages gets stored in the client registry which data is used to add context to Sensu Events7 and to detect Sensu clients in an unhealthy state Registration events If a Sensu event handler30 named registration is configured or if a Sensu client definition includes a registration attribute31 the Sensu server5 will create and process a Sensu event7 for the client registration applying any configured filters26 and mutators32 before executing the configured handlers30 Registration events are useful for executing onetime handlers for new Sensu clients For example registration event handlers can be used to update external Configuration Management Databases CMDBs34 such as ServiceNow35 etc To configure a registration event handler please refer to the Sensu event handler documentation30 for instructions on creating a handler named registration Alternatively please see Client definition registration attributes31 below WARNING registration events are not stored in the event registry in the Sensu data store8 so they are not accessible via the Sensu API however all registration events are logged in the Sensu server5 log Proxy clients Sensu proxy clients formerly known as Justintime or JIT clients are dynamically created clients added to the client registry if a client does not already exist for a check result Proxy client registration differs from keepalivebased registration because the registration event happens while processing a check result not a keepalive message If a check result includes a source attribute a proxy client will be created for the source and the check result will be stored under the newly created client Sensu proxy clients allow Sensu to monitor external resources eg on systems andor devices where a sensuclient cannot be installed such a network switches using the defined check source to create a proxy clients for the external resource Once created proxy clients work much in the same way as any other Sensu client eg they are used to store check execution history and provide context within event data NOTE keepalive monitoring is not supported for proxy clients as they are inherently unable to run a sensuclient Proxy client example Proxy clients are created when a check result includes a source attribute as follows check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite source sensuapporg issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE this source attribute can be provided in a check definition14 or included in a check result published to the Sensu client input socket36 By default proxy client data includes a minimal number of attributes The following is an example of proxy client data that is added to the registry name switchx address unknown subscriptions keepalives false The Sensu API can be used to update proxy client data in the client registry To update proxy client data please refer to the Client API reference documentation9 Create a proxy client via the client socket The following is an example of how to create a proxy client payload via the client socketclientsocketinput using netcat echo source mysql01 name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 How are keepalive events created keepaliveevents Sensu servers including Sensu Enterprise monitor the Sensu client registry for stale client data detecting clients that have failed to send client keepalive messages10 for more than 120 seconds by default When a Sensu server detects that a client hasnt sent a keepalive message within the configured threshold the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create an event this is different from how events are created for monitoring checks see How are Sensu events created11 Client keepalive configuration For more information on configuring client keepalives please see the client keepalive attribute reference documentation12 below Sensu client keepalives are published to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds Client keepalive behavior can be configured per Sensu client allowing each Sensu client to set its own alert thresholds and keepalive event handlers By default client data is considered stale if a keepalive hasnt be received in 120 seconds WARNING By default keepalive events will be sent to the Sensu handler named keepalive if defined or the default handler will be used To configure the keepalive check for a Sensu client please refer to the client keepalive attributes reference documentation12 Client signature Sensu client definitions may specify a unique string identifier as their signature which is included in each keepalive message Once a client advertises a signature via keepalives the server will expect that signature to be present in any keepalives or check results originating from the client Any keepalives or check results which do not contain a matching signature will be dropped with an invalid client signature warning in the log A client can begin to use a signature if one was not previously configured but removing a client signature requires deleting the client Providing a unique client signature prevents other clients from accidentally or maliciously submitting keepalives or check results using the same client name Client subscriptions What is a client subscription whatisasensusubscription Sensus use of the publishsubscribe pattern of communication13 allows for automated registration deregistration of ephemeral systems At the core of this model are Sensu client subscriptions Each Sensu client has a defined set of subscriptions a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc These subscriptions determine which monitoring checks are executed by the client Client subscriptions allow Sensu to request check executions on a group of systems at a time instead of a traditional 11 mapping of configured hosts to monitoring checks Sensu checks target Sensu client subscriptions using the check definition attribute subscribers14 Roundrobin client subscriptions Roundrobin client subscriptions allow checks to be executed on a single client within a subscription in a roundrobin fashion To create a roundrobin client subscription prepend the subscription name with roundrobin eg roundrobinelasticsearch Any check that targets the roundrobinelasticsearch subscription will have its check requests sent to clients in a roundrobin fashion meaning only one member client in the subscription will execute a roundrobin check each time it is published The following is a Sensu client definition that includes a roundrobin subscription client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver roundrobinwebserver The following is a Sensu check definition that targets a roundrobin subscription checks webapplicationapi command checkhttprb u httpslocalhost8080apiv1health subscribers roundrobinwebserver interval 20 Client subscription configuration To configure Sensu client subscriptions for a client please refer to the client subscriptions attribute reference documentation15 In addition to the subscriptions defined in the client configuration Sensu clients also subscribe automatically to a subscription matching their client name For example a client named i424242 will subscribe to check requests for the subscription clienti424242 This makes it possible to generate adhoc check requests targeting specific clients via the request API49 Client socket input What is the Sensu client socket Every Sensu client has a TCP UDP and HTTP socket listening for external check result input The Sensu client sockets listen by default on localhost port 3030 for TCPUDP and 3031 for HTTP and expect JSON formatted check results allowing external sources eg your web application backup scripts etc to push check results without needing to know anything about Sensus internal implementation An excellent client socket use case example is a web application pushing check results to indicate database connectivity issues To configure the Sensu client socket for a client please refer to the client socket attributes16 HTTP Socket The HTTP socket just like the TCP and UDP sockets accepts check results but it requires a wellformed HTTP request and exposes other functionality that is not possible with the raw TCPUDP sockets In exchange for a bit more complexity the HTTP socket interface has the advantage of being more expressive than a raw TCPUDP socket both in the requests that it accepts and how it responds and so exposes more functionality The following endpoints are available for the HTTP socket GET info This endpoint returns 200 OK with some basic Sensu information like the version and transport metrics POST results This endpoint expects an applicationjson body with a check result GET settings This endpoint responds with 200 OK and the sensu configuration Due to the possible sensitive nature of the client settings eg passwords might be in the config this endpoint is protected using HTTP basic authentication and by default the information returned is redacted eg common config keys like password have their values replaced by REDACTED See the redact configuration option if you need control over what is redacted This endpoint accepts the optional query string redactedfalse to disable redaction Refer to the http client socket attributes50 for details on configuring the HTTP basic authentication details that this endpoint requires GET brew This endpoint gets you some fresh coffee Try it Any requests for unknown endpoints will get a 404 with some help information in the body At the moment only unsecure HTTP no HTTPS is supported To configure the Sensu HTTP client socket please refer to the http client socket attributes50 Example client socket usage The following is an example demonstrating external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket The example uses Bashs builtin devtcp file to communicate with the Sensu client socket echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 devtcplocalhost3030 Netcat17 can also be used instead of the TCP file echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 You can do the same using the HTTP socket curl v H ContentType applicationjson X POST d name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 localhost 3031 Creating a dead mans switch The Sensu client sockets in combination with check TTLs can be used to create whats commonly referred to as dead mans switches Outside of the software industry a dead mans switch is a switch that is automatically triggered if a human operator becomes incapacitated source Wikipedia18 Sensu is more interested in detecting silent failures than incapacited human operators By using Check TTLs Sensu is able to set an expectation that a Sensu client will continue to publish results for a check at a regular interval If a Sensu client fails to publish a check result and the check TTL expires Sensu will create an event to indicate the silent failure For more information on check TTLs please refer to the check attributes reference documentation14 A great use case for the Sensu client socket is to create a dead mans switch for backup scripts to ensure they continue to run successfully at regular intervals If an external source sends a Sensu check result with a check TTL to the Sensu client socket Sensu will expect another check result from the same external source before the TTL expires The following is an example of external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket using a check TTL to create a dead mans switch for MySQL backups The example uses a check TTL of 25200 seconds or 7 hours A MySQL backup script using the following code would be expected to continue to send a check result at least once every 7 hours or Sensu will create an event7 to indicate the silent failure echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output backed up mysql successfully sizemb568 status 0 nc localhost 3030 echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output failed to backup mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 Standalone check execution scheduler In addition to subscribing to client subscriptions3 and executing check requests published by the Sensu server19 the Sensu client is able to maintain its ownseparate schedule for standalone checks20 Because the Sensu client shares the same check scheduling algorithm21 as the Sensu server it is not only possible to have consistency between subscription checks22 and standalone checks mdash its also possible to maintain consistency between standalone checks across an entire infrastructure assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP23 Client configuration Example client definition The following is an example Sensu client definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdclientjson This client definition provides Sensu with information about the system on which it resides This is a production system running a web server and a MySQL database The client name attribute is required in the definition and must be unique client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver mysql socket bind 127001 port 3030 Client definition specification The client definition uses the client configuration scope24 client attributes name "},{"title":"Sensu

configurationexamplesensuconfiguration Toplevel configuration scopestoplevelconfigurationscopes How does Sensu load configuration Sensu configuration sources By default the main configuration file for the Sensu platform is located at etcsensuconfigjson However Sensu also provides support for loading configuration from a directory containing multipledisparate configuration files andor environment variables Sensu merges configuration parameters provided from these three distinct configuration sources environment variables configuration file and configuration directories into a single Hash This type of Hash merging is often called deep merging and is probably the most important concept to understand when learning how to configure Sensu Configuration load order As previously mentioned Sensu configuration can be provided via three distinct sources environment variables a configuration file and one or more directories containing configuration files Sensu loads configuration from these sources in the following order 1 The Sensu service scripts provide command line arguments1 for starting the Sensu services eg the location of the configuration file c the location of configuration directories d etc 2 Sensu will load configuration from environment variables2 3 Sensu loads configuration from the configuration file by default this is located at etcsensuconfigjson 3 Sensu loads configuration snippets from configuration files located in a Sensu configuration directory by default this is etcsensuconfd however it is possible to configure Sensu to load from multiple configuration directories see command line arguments1 below NOTE configuration file load order is dictated by a json glob of the configuration directory as such it is strongly recommended to avoid a dependency on configuration directory file load order eg if youre attempting to name configuration files in the configuration directory to control load order youre doing it wrong Configuration merging configurationmerging To explain how Sensu merges configuration parameters from the various disparate configuration sources please note the following example scenario 1 The Sensu runtime configuration is stored as an inmemory Hash object For the purposes of providing a visual example lets imagine that this Hash object is actually a JSON document which begins life as Sensu is started as an empty JSON document Initial Sensu configuration Hash in memory When Sensu is started it will begin to collect configuration from environment variables a configuration file and one ore more configuration directories which configuration parameters will be used to build up this configuration Hash 2 For the purposes of this example lets assume that the first configuration snippet that Sensu encounters is a configuration file located at etcsensuconfigjson with the following contents New config file on disk at etcsensuconfigjson rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host 100120 port 6379 password secret At this time the Sensu configuration Hash in memory will look like Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host localhost vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret 3 Now lets see what happens when Sensu encounters another configuration snippet eg a file located in a Sensu configuration directory such as etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson New config file contents on disk at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson rabbitmq host 100110 user sensu01 password newsecret The second configuration snippet provided configuration for the rabbitmq scope some of which already exists in the Sensu configuration Hash in memory but also missing some attributes which already exist in the Sensu configuration Hash ie vhost The result of merging this configuration snippet into the Sensu configuration Hash in memory is as follows Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu01 password newsecret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret The result of the deep merge is that the configuration snippet provided by etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson was overlaid on the Sensu configuration Hash in memory essentially overwriting the previously existing values provided by the configuration snippet while not discarding configuration attributes that already existed in the rabbitmq configuration scope even though they werent provided by the configuration snippet Configuration logging As configuration snippets are applied to the Sensu configuration Hash ie during deep merge all configuration changes are logged to the corresponding log file eg the Sensu server API or Client logs Configuration scopes Because Sensu configuration can be provided in so many different sources it is important to understand that ndash regardless of the physical location of the configuration data eg from the main configuration file or from a configuration file in a configuration directory ndash all configuration must be placed in the appropriate scope in the JSON file ie the named level that attributes should be defined in For example the root or scope of the Sensu configuration would be any attributes defined at the top level of a JSON configuration file such as the configuration attributes for rabbitmq redis or the api rabbitmq redis api Attributes defined in the root scope or top level provide the corresponding scopes for additional configuration settings eg the rabbitmq attribute defined above provides the rabbitmq scope a JSON Hash for the actual RabbitMQ configuration settings Configuration scopes are relative Throughout the Sensu documentation whenever a configuration scope is mentioned it is describing the named level that the corresponding configuration attributes should be defined within which may be relative to any potentially related scopes Please note the following examples Configuration scope examples The client scope client In the Sensu Client reference documentation3 it explains that The client definition uses the client definition scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu client configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client client The client socket scope socket The Sensu Client reference documentation3 continues to explain that Sensu clients may have a socket attribute and that there are additional Client Socket attributes4 which should be defined within the socket scope The following attributes are configured within the socket client definition attribute scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu Client Socket configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client and another attribute defined within the client scope or level called socket client socket Thus when the Client Socket reference documentation continues to explain that the bind and port attributes should be defined in the Client Socket scope it means they should live under the socket level of the JSON file regardless of where you might store a configuration file containing said configuration attributes on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu client socket bind 0000 port 3031 Sensu service service configuration sensuservicescriptconfiguration The Sensu services are managed by service scripts that are provided in the Sensu packages The

gemthesensuextensiongem The Sensu Extensions gem templatethesensuextensionsgemtemplate What is a Sensu extension Unlike Sensu plugins which spawn a new child process at every execution Sensu extensions execute directly inside the EventMachine reactor thread1 of a Sensu client or server process Because they avoid the overhead of spawning a new process at every invocation Sensu extensions can fulfill the same functions as plugins acting as checks filters mutators or handlers but with much greater efficiency WARNING While their performance characteristics are quite desirable Sensu extensions come with major caveats extensions have full access to Sensus internals and any extension which blocks the EventMachine reactor for any period of time eg blocking on disk IO or network request will have a very significant negative impact on Sensus performance and functionality The details of evented programming as implemented by EventMachine are outside the scope of this document but Javier Acero has helpfully written on the implications of blocking the reactor2 Installing Sensu extensions As of version 026 Sensu supports loading extensions from properly packaged gems This approach takes advantage of the existing RubyGems infrastructure and tools to make publishing and installing Sensu extensions easy Use sensuinstall to install Sensu Extensions The Sensu Core package provides a tool called sensuinstall a simple wrapper around the Ruby gem utility The Sensu Install tool sensuinstall simplifies installation of Rubybased extensions The sensuinstall tool can be run

extensions Sensu extensions which are not properly packaged as gems are considered legacy meaning they predate the new specification for loading Sensu Extensions from gems These legacy extensions are loaded from the directory specified by the extensiondir flag provided when Sensu processes are started8 On most systems this defaults to etcsensuextensions as specified by the command flags passed to the sensuclient or sensuserver process via the service supervision scheme in use eg init runit upstart systemd etc Extensions should be installed directly into the extensions directory When an legacy extension has dependencies on thirdparty Ruby gems or other external applications those dependencies must be installed into the Sensu embedded Ruby environment as well Configuring Sensu Extensions The configurability of Sensu extensions is entirely a function of the extension code For example filters and mutators cannot be applied to an extension via a standard handler definition Instead these aspects of the extensions configuration must be defined in code by overriding the SensuExtensionBase definition method10 EXAMPLE extensionconfigurationincodeexample def definition type extension name name filters occurrences mutator onlycheckoutput end The above code would configure the associated extension to apply the occurrences filter and then the onlycheckoutput mutator prior to executing the extensions custom run method By virtue of being loaded into the Sensu client or server process Sensu extensions have access to the running Sensu configuration As such an extension can make use of any available configuration scopes9 but the prevailing convention is for extensions to use unique toplevel configuration scopes The systemprofile4 extension installed in a previous example looks to the toplevel systemprofile configuration scope The following configuration added to etcsensuconfd would change the systemprofile extensions Graphite path prefix from a default value of system to profile EXAMPLE providingextensionconfigurationexample systemprofile pathprefix profile The sensuextension gem Unlike Sensu plugins which may be written in any programming language Sensu extensions must be written in Ruby The sensuextension5 gem provides SensuExtensionBase and other classes which Sensu extensions should subclass The sensuextensions gem template The sensuextensions gem template12 provides a starting point for those who wish to author their own Sensu extension as a Ruby gem It is recommended that your gem follow the naming pattern sensuextensionNAME in order to ensure it can be easily installed with sensuinstall NOTE if you choose not to use this template for your extension note the directory structure it demonstrates eg placing extension code under libsensuextensions are required to ensure the extension is properly loaded Example extensions For simple examples of Sensu extensions consider the onlycheckoutput mutator6 or the debug handler7 both of which ship with Sensu

attributeswhenattributes What are Sensu filters Sensu Filters also called Event Filters allow you to filter events destined for one or more event Handlers1 Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keysvalues with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter recurring events ie to eliminate notification noise and to filter events from systems in preproduction environments When to use a filter Sensu Filters allow you to configure conditional logic to be applied during the event processing flow Compared to executing an event handler evaluating event filters is an inexpensive operation which can provide overall monitoring performance gains by reducing the number of events that need to be handled Additionally by using Sensu Filters instead of building conditional logic into custom Handlers conditional logic can be applied to multiple Handlers and monitoring configuration stays DRY How do Sensu filters work Sensu Filters are applied when Event Handlers1 are configured to use one or more Filters Prior to executing a Handler the Sensu server will apply any Filters configured for the Handler to the Event Data If the Event is not removed by the Filters ie filtered out the Handler will be executed The filter analysis flow performs these steps When the Sensu server is processing an Event it will check for the definition of a handler or handlers Prior to executing each Handler the Sensu server will first apply any configured filter or filters for the Handler If multiple filters are configured for a Handler they are executed sequentially Filter attributes are compared with Event data Filters can be inclusive only matching events are handled or exclusive matching events are not handled As soon as a Filter removes an Event ie filters it out no further analysis is performed and the Event Handler will not be executed NOTE Filters specified in a handler set16 definition have no effect Filters must be specified in individual handler definitions Inclusive and Exclusive Filtering Filters can be inclusive negate false or exclusive negate true Configuring a handler to use multiple inclusive filters is the equivalent of using an AND query operator ie only handle events if they match inclusive filters x AND y AND z Configuring a handler to use multiple exclusive filters is the equivalent of using an OR operator ie only handle events if they dont match x OR y OR z Inclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate false only events that match the defined filter attributes are handled Exclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate true events are only handled if they do not match the defined filter attributes NOTE unless otherwise configured in the filter definition2 the default filtering behavior is inclusive filtering ie negate false Filter attribute comparison Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data3 counterparts For inclusive filter definitions4 ie negate false matching attributes will result in the filter returning a true value for exclusive filter definitions4 ie negate true matching attributes will result in the filter returning a false value ie the event does not pass through the filter Filters that return a true value will continue to be processed mdash via additional filters if defined mutators if defined and handlers EXAMPLE The following example filter definition entitled productionfilter will match event data3 with a custom client definition attribute5 environment production filters productionfilter negate false attributes client environment production Filter attribute evaluation When more complex conditional logic is needed than direct filter attribute comparison10 Sensu filters provide support for attribute evaluation using Ruby expressions When a Filter attribute value is a string beginning with eval the remainder is evaluated as a Ruby expression The Ruby expression is evaluated in a sandbox and provided a single variable value which is equal to the event data attribute value being compared If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match Example Handling state change only Some teams migrating to Sensu have asked about reproducing the behavior of their old monitoring system which alerts only on state change This statechangeonly inclusive4 filter provides such filters statechangeonly negate false attributes occurrences eval value 1 action resolve This eval filter is effective because value of event occurrences is reset on each state change except when the event action is resolve The resolve action is set on an event when its check result status is 0 following one or more prior nonzero statuses Example Handling repeated events The following example filter definition entitled filterinterval60hourly will match event data3 with a check interval6 of 60 seconds and an occurrences value of 1 ie the first occurrence OR any occurrences value that is evenly divisible by 60 via a modulo operator7 calculation ie calculating the remainder after dividing occurrences by 60 Note that negate is true making this an exclusive filter4 if evaluation returns false the event will be handled filters filterinterval60hourly negate true attributes check interval 60 occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 The next example will apply the same logic as the previous example but for checks with a 30 second interval filters filterinterval30hourly negate true attributes check interval 30 occurrences eval value 1 value 120 0 NOTE The effect of both of these filters is that they will only allow an events with 30second or 60second intervals to be handled1 on the first occurrence of the event and again every hour Previous examples in the older Sensu docs have not included the check interval 60 attribute which has confused some users because filtering based on occurrences alone assumes some understanding of the relationship between occurrences and interval which isnt always obvious Example Handling events during office hours only This filter evaluates the event timestamp to determine if the event occurred between 9 AM and 5 PM on a weekday Remember that negate defaults to false so this is an inclusive filter If evaluation returns false the event will not be filters ninetofiver negate false attributes timestamp eval 12345includeTimeatvaluewday Timeatvaluehourbetween917 Filter attribute eval tokens What are filter attribute eval tokens Sensu filters attributes may be evaluated using Ruby expressions10 which evaluations provide support for comparing a single event attribute variable against a basic logical statement eg is value greater than 60 When additional variables are needed beyond the single value variable provided by eval tokens may be used Eval tokens are filter attribute placeholders that can be replaced by Sensu check definition attributes6 and client definition attributes8 including custom attributes Example filter attribute eval token The following is an example Sensu filter definition2 which is using a token checkoccurrences60 as a secondary attribute in the Ruby eval expression The token will be replaced by the check definition attribute6 named occurrences if it is defined otherwise it will use the fallback value of 60 filters occurrences negate true attributes occurrences eval value checkoccurrences60 This example would be useful for filtering events that dont exceed a minimum number of occurrences as configured in the check definition Filter attribute eval token specification Eval token substitution syntax Eval tokens are invoked by wrapping event data attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters before and after the attribute ie Nested event data attributes3 may be accessed via dot notation eg checkoccurrences occurrences would be replaced with the event occurrences data11 checkmythreshold would be replaced with a custom check definition attribute12 called mythreshold Eval token default values Eval token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an eval token attribute13 is not satisfied by event data3 Eval token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for events that are missing the declared token attribute checkoccurrences60 would be replaced with a check definition attribute6 called occurrences If occurrences is not defined in the check definition the default or fallback value of 60 will be used NOTE if an eval token default value is not provided ie as a fallback value and the event data does not contain a matching eval token attribute13 an log entry indicating an error called filter eval unmatched tokens will be published to the Sensu server log Filter configuration Example filter definition examplefilterdefinition The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This is an inclusive filter definition called production The effect of this filter is that only events with the custom client attribute5 environment production will

email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty ServiceNow etc or storing metrics in a timeseries database eg Graphite Handler types There are several types of handlers The most common handler type is the pipe handler which works very similarly to how checks3 work enabling Sensu to interact with almost any computer program via standard streams4 Pipe handlers Pipe handlers pipe event data into arbitrary commands via STDIN TCPUDP handlers TCP and UDP handlers send event data to a remote socket eg external API Transport handlers Transport handlers publish event data to the Sensu transport5 Handler sets Handler sets also called set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easy to manage groups of actions that should be executed for certain types of events The default handler Sensu expects all events2 to have a corresponding handler Event handlers may be configured in check definitions16 however if no handler or handlers have been configured Sensu will attempt to handle the event using a handler named15 default The default handler is only a reference ie Sensu does not provide a builtin default handler so if no handler definition exists for a handler named default Sensu will log an error indicating that the event was not handled because a default handler definition does not exist To use one or more existing handlers as the default you can create a Set handler17 called default and include the existing handlers in the set Pipe handlers Pipe handlers are external commands that can consume event data6 via STDIN Example pipe handler definition handlers examplepipehandler type pipe command dosomethingawesomerb o options Pipe handler commands What is a pipe handler command Pipe handler definitions include a command attribute which are

NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command handlerircrb TCPUDP handlers tcpudphandlers TCP and UDP handlers enable Sensu to forward event data to arbitrary TCP or UDP socketst for external services to consume eg thirdparty APIs Example TCP handler definition The following example TCP handler definition will forward event data6 to a TCP

failure When to use a mutator Many Sensu event handlers2 will modify event data1 in the course of processing an event9 and in many cases this is recommended because modifying the event data and performing some action in memory in the same process will result in better performance than executing a mutator5 and a handler two separate processes However when multiple handlers require similar event data modifications mutators provide the ability to avoid code duplication DRY and simplify event handler logic How do Sensu mutators work Sensu mutators are applied when event handlers2 are

What is the Sensu server The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests1 to client subscriptions2 via a PublishSubscribe model3 and provides a scalable event processing platform4 for processing check results and monitoring events Sensu Core vs Sensu Enterprise The Sensu server comes in two flavors the opensource Sensu Core5 via the sensuserver process and Sensu Enterprise6 via the sensuenterprise process To learn more about the differences between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise please visit the Sensu website7 NOTE Sensu Enterprise ie the sensuenterprise process was designed to be a dropin replacement for the Sensu Core server and API ie the sensuserver and sensuapi As such any mention of the Sensu server in the Sensu documentation also applies to the sensuenterprise process for Sensu Enterprise users WARNING as noted above the sensuenterprise process is designed to replace both of the Sensu Core sensuserver and sensuapi processes Because Sensu Enterprise will load the same configuration as Sensu Core it is important that the Sensu Core processes are stopped before starting Sensu Enterprise to avoid known conflicts and processing errors such as attempting to bind on the same ports etc Check execution scheduling Check execution scheduling is performed by a Sensu server see Sensu server task election8 Checks are scheduled by querying Sensus configuration for defined checks ndash excluding check with the attributes standalone true or publish false ndash and calculating when executions should occur based on their defined intervals Check scheduling algorithm synchronization checkschedulingalgorithmsynchronization Sensu uses an internal algorithm for determining a unique cadence for Sensu checks which uniqueness is based on the check name and interval This algorithm outputs a value in milliseconds which the Sensu server will use as an offset before the next check request should be published In practice this means that ndash assuming system clocks are in sync between disparate Sensu servers ndash check requests for a given check based on the check name will be published at the exact same time The also means that in the event of a Sensu server restart andor Sensu server task reelection ie if a new Sensu server is elected to become reponsible for check execution scheduling check execution scheduling intervals will remain consistent In fact because this algorithm is also shared by the Sensu client ndash which provides decentralized check execution scheduling in the form of standalone checks22 ndash a check defined on the Sensu server and a matching standalone check defined on a Sensu client should also stay in sync with each other again assuming that system clocks are in sync and the check names and intervals are consistent Event processing The Sensu server provides a scalable event processor Event processing involves conversion of check results9 into Sensu events and then applying any defined event filters10 event data mutators11 and event handlers12 All event processing happens on a Sensu server system The event processing workflow happens in the following order Event Filter Mutator Handler NOTE events that are filtered out ie removed by Sensu event filtersfilters will not continue to be mutated by event data mutatorsmutators or event handlershandlers Sensus event processing capabilities can be distributed among multiple Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster For more information on configuring a Sensu cluster please see Scaling Sensu13 below Automated task election The Sensu server processes ie sensuserver and sensuenterprise are designed to scale horizontally14 ie by adding systems No additional configuration is required to run a cluster of Sensu servers other than the location of the transport15 and data store16 When Sensu servers start they participate in an election process to automatically distribute tasks A Sensu server may be elected for more than one task A server task can only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart All Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster monitor the state of task execution on a 10second interval automatically electing a new Sensu server for a task if the current one hasnt confirmed execution in more than 30 seconds Server tasks In a Sensu server cluster responsibility for a distinct set of tasks is distributed amongst members of the cluster The tasks only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart When adding Sensu servers to a cluster restarting the existing Sensu servers in the cluster will force a redistribution of tasks Check request

silencingcomparingstashbasedandnativesilencing Migrating from stashbased silencingmigratingfromstashbasedsilencing What is Sensu Silencing As check results0 are processed by a Sensu server the server executes event handlers1 to send alerts to personnel or otherwise relay event data to external services Although event handlers can be directly configured with filters11 to improve overall signaltonoise ratio there are many scenarios in which operators receiving notifications from Sensu require an ondemand means to suppress alerts Sensus builtin silencing provides the means to suppress execution of event handlers on an adhoc basis By using a dashboard or other tool to interact with the silenced API2 operators can mute notifications onthefly The silenced API manipulates silencing entries in the Sensu data store These entries describe a combination of check name and subscription When the check name3 andor subscription4 described in a silencing entry match an event the handler will not be executed and an informational message will be logged Individual handlers may optout of silencing by configuring the handlesilenced attribute5 NOTE Silencing described in this reference document is implemented in Sensu version 026 or later and Sensu Enterprise 20 or later When to use silencing Silencing is used to prevent handlers from being triggered based on the check name present in a check result or the subscriptions associated with the client that published the check result This can be desirable in many scenarios giving operators the ability to quiet incoming alerts while coordinating their response Sensu silencing entries make it possible to Silence all checks on a specific clientsilenceallchecksonaspecificclient Silence a specific check on a specific

above combinations silencing entries support Expiration after a specified number of seconds Expiration after check returns to OK state resolves Describing the reason or rationale Describing the creator or entity responsible for an entry How does silencing work Silencing entries are created on an adhoc basis via the silenced API2 endpoint When silencing entries are successfully created via the API they are assigned an ID in the format SUBSCRIPTIONCHECK where SUBSCRIPTION is the name of a Sensu client subscription and CHECK is the name of a Sensu check Silencing entries can be used to silence checks on specific clients by by taking advantage of perclient subscriptions4 added in Sensu 026 eg clientCLIENTNAME These silencing entries are persisted to the silenced registry in the Sensu data store10 When the Sensu server processes subsequent check results it consults this registry to determine whether or not a matching silencing entry exists If one or more matching entries exist in the registry the event context for the check result is updated to indicate that the event is silenced and the ID of the entries which the check result matched When creating a silencing entry a combination of check and subscription can be specified but only one or the other is strictly required For example when a silencing entry is created specifying only a check its ID will contain an asterisk or wildcard in the SUBSCRIPTION position This indicates that any event with a matching check name will be marked as silenced regardless of the originating clients subscriptions Conversely a silencing entry which specifies only a subscription will have an ID with an asterisk in the CHECK position This indicates that any event where the originating clients subscriptions match the subscription specified in the entry will be marked as silenced regardless of the check name NOTE Starting with version 026 Sensu clients automatically add a subscription containing their client name prefixed with the string client For example client i424242 will automatically add subscription clienti424242 Silencing checks at the individual client level requires clients to run Sensu 026 or be manually configured with a client subscription Silencing entry specification Silencing entries are composed as a JSON document containing at least one of the required subscription or check attributes and additional optional attributes as desired Silencing entries are created updated and deleted by submitting JSON documents to endpoints on the silenced API2 via HTTP POST as shown in the examples

time begin epoch timestamp with an optional expiration in seconds enabling users to silence events in advance for scheduled maintenance windows NEW The Sensu API now logs the XRequestID header making it much easier to trace a requestresponse If the API client does not provide a request ID the API generates one for the request UUID IMPROVEMENT The Sensu API results endpoints now include check history in the result data IMPROVEMENT Check token substitution is now supported in check subdue Core 113 Release Notes corev113 Source GitHubcom55 CHANGES corev113changes BUGFIX Fixed a bug in the Sensu client that broke check hooks named after numeric statuses eg 2 and nonzero they were never executed unless the client had a local check definition 1773 BUGFIX systemd units now stored in

server to crash Check TTL member deletion following the deletion of the associated check result would produce an uncaught error Core 110 Release Notes corev110 Source GitHubcom49 September 27 2017 mdash Sensu Core version 110 has been released and is available for immediate download Please note the following improvements CHANGES corev110changes IMPORTANT Sensu packages include Ruby 241 Upgrading from releases of Sensu prior to 100 will require all plugin or extension gems to be reinstalled under the new Ruby environment IMPORTANT Sensu packages include sensuplugin 20050 which disables its deprecated filter methods by default ie occurrences Sensu releases since 100 include builtin filters that provide the same functionality with several improvements The builtin filters are occurrences51 and checkdependencies52 To use the builtin filters apply them to Sensu event handlers via their definition filters attribute eg filters occurrences checkdependencies These filters can now be used with Sensu event handlers that do not use the sensuplugin library or Ruby NEW Check hooks commands run by the Sensu client in response to the result of the check command execution The Sensu client will execute the appropriate configured hook command depending on the check execution status eg 1 Valid hook names include in order of precedence 1255 ok warning critical unknown and nonzero The check hook command output status executed timestamp and duration are captured and published in the check result Check hook commands can optionally receive JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data via STDIN NEW Check STDIN A boolean check definition attribute stdin when set to true instructs the Sensu client to write JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data to the check command process STDIN This attribute cannot be used with existing Sensu check plugins nor Nagios plugins etc as the Sensu client will wait indefinitely for the check process to read and close STDIN IMPROVEMENT Splayed proxy check request publishing Users can now splay proxy check requests optional evenly over a window of time determined by the check interval and a configurable splay coverage percentage For example if a check has an interval of 60s and a configured splay coverage of 90 its proxy check requests would be splayed evenly over a time window of 60s 90 54s leaving 6s for the last proxy check execution before the the next round of proxy check requests for the same check Proxy check request splayed publishing can be configured with two new check definition attributes within the proxyrequests scope splay boolean to enable it and splaycoverage integer percentage defaults to 90 IMPROVEMENT Configurable check output truncation for storage in Redis Check output truncation can be manually enableddisabled with the check definition attribute truncateoutput egtruncateoutput false The output truncation length can be configured with the check definition attribute truncateoutputlength eg truncateoutputlength 1024 Check output truncation is still enabled by default for metric checks with type metric IMPROVEMENT Sensu client HTTP socket basic authentication can how be applied to all endpoints not just settings via the client definition httpsocket attribute protectallendpoints eg protectallendpoints true IMPROVEMENT Improved check TTL monitoring performance IMRPOVEMENT The Sensu extension run log event log level is now set to debug instead of info when the run output is empty and the status is 0 BUGFIX Added initial timestamp to proxy client definitions The Uchiwa and Sensu dashboards will no longer display Invalid Date BUGFIX Deleting check history when deleting an associated check result Core 104 Release Notes corev104 October 17 2017 mdash Sensu

Sensu Core Sensu Enterprise Sensu Training Professional Services for Sensu and more If you need support for Sensu please consider giving Sensu Enterprisehttpssensuapporggetstarted a try Do I need RabbitMQ to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq as a Transportreferencetransport Sensu services require access to a shared instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscription topics Does Redis need to be installed on every system I wish to monitor No Sensu uses Redisreferenceredis as a data store and the Sensu server services ie sensuserver sensuapi for Sensu Core sensuenterprise for Sensu Enterprise require access to the same Redis instance or cluster to store and access the Sensu client registry check results check execution history and current event data Do check definitions need to exist on every system I wish to monitor No Check definitions can be written as publishsubscribe pubsub or standalone Pubsub checks which specify a list of subscribers need only be configured on the Sensu server Standalone checks which are scheduled and executed by the Sensu client need only be configured on the clients where they should be run Where should check plugin executables be installed Regardless of where checks are defined the actual check executables need to exist on the filesystem for the Sensu client to execute them Check plugin executables can be installed in etcsensuplugins or optsensuembeddedbin the latter being the location where plugin executables are installed via sensuinstall What is a standalone check A standalone check is a check definition that is installed on and executed by the Sensu client without being scheduled by the Sensu server Standalone checks defer Check execution scheduling responsibilitiesoverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler to Sensu clients enabling decentralized management of monitoring checks and distribution of scheduling responsibilities Standalone checks may be used in conjunction with pubsub checks and are distinguished from pubsub checks by inclusion of the standalone true configuration parameter What happens if a single check is defined on both the Sensu server and client When a check request is published for a check defined on the Sensu server the Sensu client will look for a local definition matching the check name prior to executing the check If a local definition exists it is mergedreferenceconfigurationconfigurationmerging with the definition provided by the server with any local definition attributes overriding the definition provided by the Sensu server What is Sensu Client safemode In safemode a client will not run a check published by a Sensu server unless that check is also defined on the client Safe mode must be enabled on the Sensu Client via the safemode configuration attribute Can multiple Sensu servers be run concurrently in a cluster Yes Sensu is designed to be scaled horizontally ie by adding additional Sensu servers It supports fully automated leader election ensuring that a single Sensu server acts as a centralized Check Execution Scheduleroverviewarchitecturecheckexecutionscheduler automated failover automatically electing a new leader if the previous leader is unexpectedly unavailable and distributed event processing check results are distributed across all Sensu servers in a roundrobin fashion

client process requires access to the Sensu Transportreferencetransport by default this is RabbitMQreferencerabbitmq see Sensu Configurationreferenceconfigurationtoplevelconfigurationscopes and some minimal client configuration eg a name address and one or more subscriptions in order to start When the Sensu client process starts it begins sending keepalives ndash a special type of check result containing client configuration data ndash which the Sensu server uses to know that a client is still connected When a client keepalive is received for a client name that is not currently registered with Sensu the client is added to the registry and a registration event is created automatically Do system clocks need to be synchronized Yes The Sensu services ie sensuclient sensuserver sensuapi sensuenterprise use the localsystem clock for generating timestamps When system clocks are out of sync between Sensu clients where data is collected and the Sensu server where data is processed Sensu

Core","version":"1.2","location":"/sensu-core/1.2/guides/adding-a-client","display_name":"Sensu Core 1.2: Adding a Client","content":"Sensu clients are pieces of infrastructure that Sensu monitors for you The Sensu client software allows you to register a running instance of itself as capable of running any checks they might be eligible for Infrastructure sometimes includes hardware or services that dont necessarily support running the Sensu client software but still needs to be monitored For those cases proxy clientsproxyclients let you monitor anything you can tell Sensu about Adding a Sensu Client One of the first challenges new Sensu users often encounter is learning what is required to get a remote Sensu client1 to communicate with the Sensu server2 If youre in a hurry skip ahead to add a remote Sensu client3 for stepbystep instructions Alternatively once you understand the two requirements for adding Sensu clients youll know everything you need to start deploying Sensu clients to your entire infrastructure Please continue reading to learn how adding Sensu clients starts with configuration4 and is ultimately all about the transport5 It starts with configuration Sensu is designed to be operated via configuration This core philosophy is what enables Sensu to work so seamlessly with modern automation solutions and configuration management platforms To learn more about how Sensu is configured please consult the Sensu configuration reference documentation6 The Sensu client requires a minimal amount of configuration to enable it to automatically register itself7 with the Sensu server which configuration includes a client definition8 eg the client name address and subscriptions and a transport definition9 Its all about the transport The Sensu processes use a transport10 a message bus for communication By default this is RabbitMQ11 but modern versions of Sensu have added support for alternative transports12 including Redis13 Without a transport connection a Sensu client will be unable to send monitoring data eg keepalive messages14 check results15 etc In order to connect to the transport the Sensu client will need three pieces of information Which transport to use this tells Sensu which transport library should it load and which configuration scope should it use to obtain connection details A valid transport definition this provides Sensu with an IP address or hostname and any security credentials needed to connect to the transport Network access to the transport socket ie the Sensu client will need outbound network access and the transport will need to be configured to listen for remote network connections Add a remote Sensu client With the exception of Sensu clients that are running on the Sensu server which is very useful and strongly recommended all Sensu clients are essentially remote clients as they have to establish network communication to send monitoring data eg client keepalives14 and check results15 Please note the following steps that are required to add a remote Sensu client 1 Configure the client Create a client definition located at etcsensuconfdclientjson with the following contents replacing the values for the client name address and subscriptions with the corresponding values for the client you are adding client name i041256 address 8888 subscriptions default webserver 2 Tell the client which transport to use Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdtransportjson with the following contents replacing the value for the transport name with the corresponding value for the transport you are using eg use transport redis if you are using the Redis transport transport name rabbitmq reconnectonerror true 3 Tell the client how to connect to the transport Create a transport definition at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson or etcsensuconfdredisjson if you are using the Redis transport NOTE please consult the corresponding reference documentation for RabbitMQ11 or Redis13 for more configuration examples and detailed information on how to configure Sensus connection 4 Start the client Start the Sensu client and verify connectivity by consulting the Sensu client log file NOTE The service command will not work on CentOS 5 the sysvinit script must be used eg sudo etcinitdsensuclient start sudo service sensuclient start Proxy Clients Sometimes a logical piece of infrastructure isnt a device we can run Sensu on Fundamentally Sensu gives you the flexibility to separate how checks run from where they run which lets you monitor arbitrary named black box devices or services For example you may have a router that you cant run Sensu on but publishes interesting information over SNMP that you want to gather metrics from Or maybe your monitor which other datacenters are visibleonline to you or have any number of creative use cases You can create a proxy client16 that can have attributes for use in check execution allowing you to use the client registry naturally for managed an unmanaged infrastructure See the reference for creating proxy clients16 or details on writing checks against them17 for more Troubleshooting 1 referenceclients 2 referenceserver 3

Sensu users create monitoring checks At the conclusion of this guide you the user should have several Sensu checks in place to monitor and measure machine resources applications and services Each Sensu monitoring check in this guide demonstrates one or more check definition features for more information please refer to the Sensu checks reference documentation1 Objectives What will be covered in this guide Creation of standard checks functional tests Creation of metric collection checks server resources etc Creation of metric analysis checks querying time series data etc What are Sensu checks whataresensuchecks Sensu checks allow you to monitor server resources services and application health as well as collect analyze metrics they are executed on servers running the Sensu client Checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state The common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Create a standard check Standard Sensu checks are used to determine the health of server resources services and applications A standard check will query a resource for information to determine its state Once a standard check has determined the resource state it outputs a human readable message and exits with the appropriate exit status code to indicate its stateseverity OK WARNING etc Monitor the cron service The following instructions install the check dependencies and configure the Sensu check definition in order to monitor the Cron service Install dependencies checkcroninstalldependencies The checkprocessrb script provided by the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 can reliably detect if a service such as Cron is running or not The following instructions will install the Sensu Process Checks Plugin2 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkprocessrb script sudo sensuinstall p processchecks006 Create the check definition for Cron The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcheckcronjson This check definition uses the checkprocessrb script installed above3 to determine if the Cron service is running The check is named cron and it runs checkprocessrb p cron on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 60 seconds interval NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron subscribers production interval 60 For a full listing of the checkprocessrb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbincheckprocessrb h Currently the Cron check definition requires that check requests be sent to Sensu clients with the production subscription This is known as pubsub check Optionally a check may use standalone mode which allows clients to schedule their own check executions The following is an example of the Cron check using standalone mode true The Cron check will now be executed every 60 seconds on each Sensu client with the check definition A Sensu check definition with standalone true does not need to specify subscribers checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 By default Sensu checks use the default Sensu event handler for events they create To specify a different Sensu event handler for a check use the handler attribute The debug event handler used in this example will log the Sensu event data to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron standalone true interval 60 handler debug Using multiple handlers To specify multiple Sensu event handlers use the handlers attribute plural NOTE if both handler and handlers plural check definition attributes are used handlers will take precedence checks cron command checkprocessrb p cron

collection checks can output metric data in a variety of metric formats Graphite plaintext4 Nagios Performance Data5 OpenTSDB6 Metrics 20 wire format7 Measuring CPU utilization Install dependencies cpumetricsinstalldependencies The metricscpurb script provided by the Sensu CPU Checks Plugin8 collects and outputs CPU metrics in the Graphite plaintext format The following instructions will install the Sensu CPU Checks Plugin8 version 003 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the metricscpurb script sudo sensuinstall p cpuchecks003 Create the check definition for CPU metrics The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdcpumetricsjson This check definition uses the metricscpurb script installed above9 to collect CPU metrics and output them in the Graphite plaintext format By default Sensu checks with an exit status code of 0 for OK do not create events unless they indicate a change in state from a nonzero status to a zero status ie resulting in a resolve action see Sensu Events10 Metric collection checks will output metric data regardless of the check exit status code however they usually exit 0 To ensure events are always created for a metric collection check the check type of metric is used The check is named cpumetrics and it runs metricscpurb on Sensu clients with the production subscription every 10 seconds interval The debug handler is used to log the graphite plaintext CPU metrics to the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise log NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks cpumetrics type metric command metricscpurb subscribers production interval 10 handler debug For a full listing of the metricscpurb command line arguments run optsensuembeddedbinmetricscpurb h Create a metric analysis check A metric analysis check analyzes metric data which may or may not have been collected by a metrics collection check11 By querying external metric stores eg Graphite to perform data evaluations metric analysis checks allow you to perform powerful analytics based on trends in metric data rather than a single data point For example where monitoring and alerting on a single CPU utilization data point can result in false positive events based on momentary spikes monitoring and alerting on CPU utilization data over a specified period of time will improve alerting accuracy Because metric analysis checks require interaction with an external metric store providing a functional example is outside of the scope of this guide However assuming the existence of a Graphite installation that is populated with metric data the following example checks could be used The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 The check queries Graphite for a calculated moving average using the last 10 data points of the load balancer session count The session count moving average is compared with the provided alert thresholds A Sensu client running on the Graphite server would be responsible for scheduling and executing this check standalone mode NOTE Sensu services must be restarted in order to pick up configuration changes Sensu Enterprise can be reloaded checks sessioncount command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t movingAveragelb1assetsbackendsessioncurrent10 w 100 c 200 standalone true interval 30 The following check uses the checkgraphitedatarb script provided by the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 to query the Graphite API at localhost9001 for disk capacity metrics The Graphite API query uses highestCurrent to grab only the highest disk capacity metric to be compared with the provided alert thresholds This check will trigger an event alert when one or more disks on any machine are at the configured capacity threshold In this example configuration the check is configured to warn at 85 capacity w 85 and to raise a critical alert at 95 capacity c 95 checks diskcapacity command checkgraphitedatarb s localhost9001 t highestCurrentdiskcapacity1 w 85 c 95 a 120 standalone true interval 30 The following instructions will install the Sensu Graphite Plugin12 version 006 using Sensus embedded Ruby providing the checkgraphitedatarb script sudo sensuinstall p graphite006 Checking on Other Clients proxyclients Sensu supports running checks where the results are considered to be for a client that isnt actually the one executing the check regardless of whether that client is a Sensu client or simply a proxy client14 There are a number of reasons for this use case but fundamentally Sensu handles it the same Checks are scheduled normally but by specifying a Proxy Request13 in your check clients that match certain definitions their clientattributes cause the check to run for each one The attributes supplied must normally match exactly as stated no variables or directives have any special meaning but you can still use eval to perform more complicated filtering with Ruby on the available value such as finding clients with particular subscriptions given that were dealing with

an event filter Creation of an event filter with Ruby and math What are Sensu filters whataresensufilters Sensu filters allow you to filter out events destined for one or more event handlers Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keyvalues pairs with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter event recurrences to eliminate notification noise and to filter events that are not for production machines Create an event filter Inclusive filtering The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This filter definition will include events that match the filter criteria In this example the filter itself is named production which matches events with a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production Exclusive filtering To exclude events based on filter criteria set the negate filter definition attribute to true In this example the production filter will match events that do not have a custom client attribute entitled environment with the value production filters production attributes client environment production negate true Using a filter To use the production filter for an event handler set the filter attribute in the handler

plural NOTE if both filter and filters plural handler definition attributes are used filters will take precedence handlers mail type pipe command mailx s sensu event exampleaddresscom filters production operations Create an event filter with Ruby and math Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data counterparts via Ruby object comparison However it is also possible to use Ruby expressions to evaluate event data attribute values When a filter attribute value is a string that begins with eval the remainder of the string is evaluated as a Ruby expression The event data attribute value is provided to the Ruby expression as a variable entitled value If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match This Ruby expression evaluation is performed in a sandbox for safety The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterrecurrencesjson This filter excludes events that are not the first event occurrence and those that do not have an occurrence count divisible by 60 without a remainder recurrence Logically if checks with an execution interval of 1 minute are generating events every minute

Creation of a tcp handler Creation of a udp handler Creation of a transport handler Creation of a set handler What are Sensu event handlers whataresensueventhandlers Sensu event handlers are for taking action on events2 produced by check results such as sending an email alert creating or resolving a PagerDuty incident or storing metrics in Graphite There are several types of handlers pipe tcp udp transport and set Pipe handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the created process via STDIN TCP and UDP handlers send the event data to a remote socket Transport handlers publish the event data to the Sensu transport by default this is RabbitMQ Set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easier to manage many event handlers Create a pipe handler Pipe event handlers execute a command and pass the event data to the corresponding process via STDIN Install dependencies The following instructions install the eventfile Sensu handler plugin written in Ruby to etcsensupluginseventfilerb This handler plugin reads the event data via STDIN parses it creates a file name using the parsed event data and then writes the event data to the file eg tmpclientnamechecknamejson sudo wget O etcsensupluginseventfilerb httpsensuapporgdocs12fileseventfilerb sudo chmod x etcsensupluginseventfilerb The eventfile Sensu plugin requires a Ruby runtime

handlers send event data to a remote socket Both TCP and UDP handler types use the same definition attributes The following TCP handler instructions will work for UDP with minor adjustments Because TCP and UDP handlers require interaction with an external service providing a functional example is outside of the scope of this guide However the following instructions will allow you to run a simple TCP socket that echoes any input to STDOUT for testing purposes Run a TCP server To test the TCP handler a listening TCP socket server is required For the following examples netcat nc will be used as the TCP server The following command will create a TCP socket server listening on port 6000 NOTE netcat will output messages that it receives in the terminal window This command will need to be run in a separate terminal window nc l k 4 p 6000 To test the netcat TCP socket server run the following command and observe the netcat output testing echo testing nc localhost 6000 Create the TCP handler

commands or scripts that receive JSON formatted event data via STDIN and output the mutated event data to STDOUT Mutators use an exit status code of 0 to indicate a success anything else indicates a failure If a mutator fails to execute nonzero exit status code the event will not be handled and an error will be logged Create an event data mutator Coming soon Please see the Mutators1 reference

Sensu provides over other monitoring solutions is its architecture which facilitates the execution of service checks collection of metric data and event processing at scale This architecture is comprised of the following components Secure Transportsecuretransport Data Storedatastore Check Execution Schedulercheckexecutionscheduler Monitoring Agentmonitoringagent Event Processoreventprocessor RESTful APIrestfulapi Architectural Diagram Sensu Architecture Gifimagessensudiagramgif Secure Transport Sensu services use a message bus eg RabbitMQ1 to communicate with one another technically speaking the Sensu services dont actually communicate with each other they only communicate with the message bus As of Sensu Core version 013 this message bus communication in Sensu has been abstracted as the Sensu Transport2 making it possible to leverage alternate transport solutions in place of RabbitMQ the default Transport Sensu services requires access to the same instance of the defined Sensu Transport eg a RabbitMQ cluster to function Sensu check requests and check results are published as messages to the Sensu Transport and the corresponding Sensu services receive these messages by subscribing to the appropriate subscriptions Data Store Sensu leverages a data store3 for data persistence Only the Sensu server API and dashboard services require access to the data store mdash the Sensu client4 monitoring agent does not By storing data in Redis the Sensu services themselves can remain stateless Although Sensu is designed to route telemetry data to external timeseries databases eg Graphite5 Librato6 InfluxDB7 etc Sensu does store the following state data Client registry8 Check history Event registry Stashes a keyvalue store provided by the Sensu API9 Check Execution Scheduler checkexecutionscheduler Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu server and the Sensu client monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks on the local system only Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive so monitoring checks may be configured for both of Sensus schedulers the Sensu server and Sensu client and Sensu will ensure that the corresponding checks are executed on the appropriate systems Monitoring Agent The Sensu client is a fully featured monitoring agent which provides the following features dynamic selfregistration client subscriptions for monitoring checks configured via the PublishSubscribe model a local check execution scheduler10 an execution platform for monitoring the local system services andor external resources an input socket for accepting input from external services Event Processor eventprocessor The Sensu server is a scalable event processor that processes event data and takes action Sensus event processing capabilities include Registering and deregistering clients Processing check results Processing monitoring events using filters11 mutators12 and handlers13 Sensus event processor is designed to scale along with the applications and infrastructure it is monitoring Although Event Handlers are executed locally by the Sensu server multiple instances of the Sensu server can be run without any additional configuration Sensu provides builtin task election to avoid scheduling conflicts between Sensu servers and the Sensu transport14 distributes via roundrobin check results between Sensu servers for processing which provides loadbalancing RESTful API Sensu provides access to monitoring data and core functionality via a RESTful HTTP JSON API including A Clients API15 for accessing Client data and addingremoving

complex monitoring problems at scale yet simple enough to use for traditional monitoring scenarios and small environments It achieves this broad appeal via building upon two simple yet powerful monitoring primitives Service Checks16 and Event Processing7 These building blocks also provide an infinitely extensible framework for composing monitoring solutions What is a Service Check servicechecks Service checks allow you to monitor services eg is Nginx running or measure resources eg how much disk space do I have left Service checks are executed on machines running a monitoring agent ie Sensu client17 Service checks are essentially commands or scripts that output data to STDOUT or STDERR and produce an exit status code to indicate a state Common exit status codes used are 0 for OK 1 for WARNING 2 for CRITICAL and 3 or greater to indicate UNKNOWN or CUSTOM Sensu checks use the same specification as Nagios therefore Nagios check plugins may be used with Sensu Service checks produce results that are processed by the event processor ie the Sensu server Learn more 17 What is Event Processing eventprocessing Event processing also called stream processing is a method of analyzing processing and storing streams of information data about things that happen events deriving a conclusion from them and potentially executing some action handling The Sensu event processor the Sensu server enables you to execute Handlers18 for taking action on events produced by service checks such as sending an email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty or ServiceNow

attributescheckresultclientattributes What is a Sensu check Sensu checks are commands executed by the Sensu client1 which monitor a condition eg is Nginx running or collect measurements eg how much disk space do I have left Although the Sensu client will attempt to execute any command defined for a check successful processing of check results requires adherence to a simple specification Sensu check specification Result data is output to STDOUT or STDERR2 For standard checks this output is typically a humanreadable message For metrics checks this output contains the measurements gathered by the check Exit status code indicates state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an UNKNOWN or custom status PRO TIP Those familiar with the Nagios3 monitoring system may recognize this specification as it is the same one used by Nagios plugins As a result Nagios plugins can be used with Sensu without any modification At every execution of a check command ndash regardless of success or failure ndash the Sensu client publishes the checks result4 for eventual handling by the event processor5 ie the Sensu server6 Check commands What is a check command Each Sensu check definition7 defines a command and the interval at which it should be executed Check commands are literally executable commands which will be executed on the Sensu client1 run as the sensu user Most check commands are provided by Sensu check plugins8 Check command arguments Sensu check command attributes may include command line arguments for controlling the behavior of the command executable Most Sensu check plugins8 provide support for command line arguments for reusability How and where are check commands executed As mentioned above all check commands are executed by Sensu clients1 as the sensu user Commands must be executable files that are discoverable on the Sensu client system ie installed in a system PATH directory9 NOTE By default the Sensu installer packages will modify the system PATH for the Sensu processes to include etcsensuplugins As a result executable scripts eg plugins located in etcsensuplugins will be valid commands This allows command attributes to use relative paths for Sensu plugin commands eg command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg Check execution platform How are checks scheduled Sensu offers two distinct check execution schedulers the Sensu serverserver and the Sensu client10 monitoring agent The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests to client subscriptions via a PublishSubscribe model11 ie subscription checkssubscriptionchecks The Sensu client monitoring agent schedules and executes standalone checks12 on the local system only Because Sensus execution schedulers are not mutually exclusive any Sensu client may be configured to both schedule and execute its own standalone checks as well as execute subscription checks scheduled by the Sensu server Subscription checks Sensu checks which are centrally defined and scheduled by the Sensu server6 are called subscription checks Sensus use of a message bus transport13 for communication enables topicbased communication14 mdash where messages are published to a specific topic and consumers subscribe to one or more specific topics This form of communication is commonly referred to as the publishsubscribe pattern11 or pubsub for short Subscription checks have a defined set of subscribers15 a list of transport13 topics14 that check requests will be published to Sensu clients become subscribers to these topics ie subscriptions via their individual client definition16 subscriptions attribute In practice subscriptions will typically correspond to a specific role andor responsibility eg a webserver database etc Subscriptions are a powerful primitives in the monitoring context because they allow you to effectively monitor for specific behaviors or characteristics corresponding to the function being provided by a particular system For example disk capacity thresholds might be more important or at least different on a database server as opposed to a webserver conversely CPU andor memory usage thresholds might be more important on a caching system than on a file server Subscriptions also allow you to configure check requests for an entire group or subgroup of systems rather than require a traditional 11 mapping Standalone checks Sensu checks which are defined on a Sensu client1 with the check definition attribute17 standalone set to true are called standalone checks The Sensu client provides its own scheduler10 for scheduling standalone checks which ensures scheduling consistency between Sensu clients with identical check definitions assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP18 Standalone checks are an important complement to subscription checks19 because they provide a decentralized management alternative for Sensu Check results What is a check result A check result is a JSON20 document published as a message on the Sensu transport13 by the Sensu client upon completion of a check execution Sensu check results include the check definition attributes17 eg command subscribers interval name etc including custom attributes21 the client name the result was submitted from and the output of the check Example check result output check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE please refer to the check result specification38 below for more information about check results Check token substitution What is check token substitution Sensu check definitions17 may include attributes that you may wish to override on a clientbyclient basis For example check commands23 ndash which may include command line arguments23 for controlling the behavior of the check command ndash may benefit from clientspecific thresholds etc Sensu check tokens are check definition placeholders that will be replaced by the Sensu client with the corresponding client definition attribute16 values including custom attributes24 NOTE Sensu check tokens were formerly known as check command tokens which limited token substitution to the check command attribute command tokens were also sometimes referred to as Sensu client overrides a reference to the fact that command tokens allowed client attributes to override check command arguments23 NOTE Check tokens are processed before check execution therefore token substitution will not apply to check data delivered via the local client socket input46 Example check tokens The following is an example Sensu check definition17 using three check tokens for check command arguments23 In this example the checkdiskusagerb command accepts w warning and c critical arguments to indicate the thresholds as percentages for creating warning or critical events As configured this check will create a warning event at 80 disk capacity unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskwarning80 and a critical event will be created if disk capacity reaches 90 unless a different threshold is provided by the client definition ie diskcritical90 This example also creates a custom check definition attribute called environment which will default to a value of production unless a different value is provided by the client definition ie environmentproduction checks checkdiskusage command checkdiskusagerb w diskwarning80 c diskcritical90 subscribers production interval 60 environment environmentproduction The following example Sensu client definition16 would provide the necessary attributes to override the diskwarning diskcritical and environment tokens declared above client name i424242 address 1002100 subscriptions production webserver mysql disk warning 75 critical 85 environment development Check token specification Token substitution syntax Check tokens are invoked by wrapping references to client attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters ie Nested Sensu client definition attributes16 can be accessed via dot notation eg diskwarning address would be replaced with the client address attribute26 url would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url diskwarning would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called warning nested inside of a JSON hash called disk Token substitution default values checktokendefaultvalues Check token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an attribute is not provided by the client definition16 Check token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for clients that are missing the declared token attribute urlhttpssensuapporg would be replaced with a custom attribute24 called url If no such attribute called url is included in the client definition the default or fallback value of httpssensuapporg will be used Unmatched tokens If a token substitution default value25 is not provided ie as a fallback value and the Sensu client definition does not have a matching definition attribute a check result4 indicating unmatched tokens will be published for the check execution eg Unmatched check tokens diskwarning Check hooks What are check hooks whatarecheckhooks Check hooks are commands run by the Sensu client in response to the result of check command execution The Sensu client will execute the appropriate configured hook command depending on the check execution status eg 1 Valid hook names include in order of precedence 1255 ok warning critical unknown and nonzero The check hook command output status executed timestamp and duration are captured and published in the check result Check hook commands can optionally receive JSON serialized Sensu client and check definition data via STDIN Example check hooks Check hooks can be used for automated data gathering for incident triage for example a check hook could be used to capture the process tree when a process has been determined to be not running etc checks nginxprocess command checkprocessrb p nginx subscribers proxy interval 60 hooks nonzero command ps aux Check hooks can also be used for rudimentary autoremediation tasks for example starting a process that is no longer running checks nginxprocess command checkprocessrb p nginx subscribers proxy interval 60 hooks critical command sudo systemctl start nginx Check configuration Example check definition The following is an example Sensu check definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdchecksensuwebsitejson This check definition uses a Sensu plugin27 named checkhttprb28 to ensure that the Sensu website is still available The check is named sensuwebsite and it runs on Sensu clients with the production subscription15 at an interval of 60 seconds checks sensuwebsite command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers production interval 60 contact ops Check definition specification Check naming checknames Each check definition has a unique check name used for the definition key Every check definition is within the checks configuration scope29 A unique string used to nameidentify the check Cannot contain special characters or spaces Validated with Ruby regex30 wmatchcheckname CHECK attributes The following attributes are configured within the checks CHECK configuration scope29 where CHECK is a valid check name41 type "},{"title":"Clients","product":"Sensu

every system eg server container etc that needs to be monitored The client is responsible for registering the system with Sensu sending client keepalive2 messages the Sensu heartbeat mechanism and executing monitoring checks Each client is a member of one or more subscriptions3 ndash a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc Sensu clients will subscribe to or watch for check requests4 published by the Sensu server5 via the Sensu Transport6 execute the corresponding requests locally and publish the results of the check back to the transport to be processed by a Sensu server Client keepalives What is a client keepalive Sensu Client keepalives are the heartbeat mechanism used by Sensu to ensure that all registered Sensu clients are still operational and able to reach the Sensu Transport6 Sensu clients publish keepalive messages containing client configuration data to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds If a Sensu client fails to send keepalive messages over a period of 120 seconds by default the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create a keepalive event7 Keepalives can be used to identify unhealthy systems and network partitions among other things and keepalive events can trigger email notifications and other useful actions Client registration the client registry registrationandregistry In practice client registrations happens when a Sensu server processes a client keepalive message for a client that is not already registered in the Sensu client registry based on the configured client name or source attribute This client registry is stored in the Sensu data store8 and is accessible via the Sensu Clients API9 All Sensu client data provided in client keepalive messages gets stored in the client registry which data is used to add context to Sensu Events7 and to detect Sensu clients in an unhealthy state Registration events If a Sensu event handler30 named registration is configured or if a Sensu client definition includes a registration attribute31 the Sensu server5 will create and process a Sensu event7 for the client registration applying any configured filters26 and mutators32 before executing the configured handlers30 Registration events are useful for executing onetime handlers for new Sensu clients For example registration event handlers can be used to update external Configuration Management Databases CMDBs34 such as ServiceNow35 etc To configure a registration event handler please refer to the Sensu event handler documentation30 for instructions on creating a handler named registration Alternatively please see Client definition registration attributes31 below WARNING registration events are not stored in the event registry in the Sensu data store8 so they are not accessible via the Sensu API however all registration events are logged in the Sensu server5 log Proxy clients Sensu proxy clients formerly known as Justintime or JIT clients are dynamically created clients added to the client registry if a client does not already exist for a check result Proxy client registration differs from keepalivebased registration because the registration event happens while processing a check result not a keepalive message If a check result includes a source attribute a proxy client will be created for the source and the check result will be stored under the newly created client Sensu proxy clients allow Sensu to monitor external resources eg on systems andor devices where a sensuclient cannot be installed such a network switches using the defined check source to create a proxy clients for the external resource Once created proxy clients work much in the same way as any other Sensu client eg they are used to store check execution history and provide context within event data NOTE keepalive monitoring is not supported for proxy clients as they are inherently unable to run a sensuclient Proxy client example Proxy clients are created when a check result includes a source attribute as follows check status 0 command checkhttprb u httpssensuapporg subscribers demo interval 60 name sensuwebsite source sensuapporg issued 1458934742 executed 1458934742 duration 0637 output CheckHttp OK 200 78572 bytesn client sensudocs NOTE this source attribute can be provided in a check definition14 or included in a check result published to the Sensu client input socket36 By default proxy client data includes a minimal number of attributes The following is an example of proxy client data that is added to the registry name switchx address unknown subscriptions keepalives false The Sensu API can be used to update proxy client data in the client registry To update proxy client data please refer to the Client API reference documentation9 Create a proxy client via the client socket The following is an example of how to create a proxy client payload via the client socketclientsocketinput using netcat echo source mysql01 name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 How are keepalive events created keepaliveevents Sensu servers including Sensu Enterprise monitor the Sensu client registry for stale client data detecting clients that have failed to send client keepalive messages10 for more than 120 seconds by default When a Sensu server detects that a client hasnt sent a keepalive message within the configured threshold the Sensu server or Sensu Enterprise will create an event this is different from how events are created for monitoring checks see How are Sensu events created11 Client keepalive configuration For more information on configuring client keepalives please see the client keepalive attribute reference documentation12 below Sensu client keepalives are published to the Sensu transport every 20 seconds Client keepalive behavior can be configured per Sensu client allowing each Sensu client to set its own alert thresholds and keepalive event handlers By default client data is considered stale if a keepalive hasnt be received in 120 seconds WARNING By default keepalive events will be sent to the Sensu handler named keepalive if defined or the default handler will be used To configure the keepalive check for a Sensu client please refer to the client keepalive attributes reference documentation12 Client signature Sensu client definitions may specify a unique string identifier as their signature which is included in each keepalive message Once a client advertises a signature via keepalives the server will expect that signature to be present in any keepalives or check results originating from the client Any keepalives or check results which do not contain a matching signature will be dropped with an invalid client signature warning in the log A client can begin to use a signature if one was not previously configured but removing a client signature requires deleting the client Providing a unique client signature prevents other clients from accidentally or maliciously submitting keepalives or check results using the same client name Client subscriptions What is a client subscription whatisasensusubscription Sensus use of the publishsubscribe pattern of communication13 allows for automated registration deregistration of ephemeral systems At the core of this model are Sensu client subscriptions Each Sensu client has a defined set of subscriptions a list of roles andor responsibilities assigned to the system eg a webserver database etc These subscriptions determine which monitoring checks are executed by the client Client subscriptions allow Sensu to request check executions on a group of systems at a time instead of a traditional 11 mapping of configured hosts to monitoring checks Sensu checks target Sensu client subscriptions using the check definition attribute subscribers14 Roundrobin client subscriptions Roundrobin client subscriptions allow checks to be executed on a single client within a subscription in a roundrobin fashion To create a roundrobin client subscription prepend the subscription name with roundrobin eg roundrobinelasticsearch Any check that targets the roundrobinelasticsearch subscription will have its check requests sent to clients in a roundrobin fashion meaning only one member client in the subscription will execute a roundrobin check each time it is published The following is a Sensu client definition that includes a roundrobin subscription client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver roundrobinwebserver The following is a Sensu check definition that targets a roundrobin subscription checks webapplicationapi command checkhttprb u httpslocalhost8080apiv1health subscribers roundrobinwebserver interval 20 Client subscription configuration To configure Sensu client subscriptions for a client please refer to the client subscriptions attribute reference documentation15 In addition to the subscriptions defined in the client configuration Sensu clients also subscribe automatically to a subscription matching their client name For example a client named i424242 will subscribe to check requests for the subscription clienti424242 This makes it possible to generate adhoc check requests targeting specific clients via the request API49 Client socket input What is the Sensu client socket Every Sensu client has a TCP UDP and HTTP socket listening for external check result input The Sensu client sockets listen by default on localhost port 3030 for TCPUDP and 3031 for HTTP and expect JSON formatted check results allowing external sources eg your web application backup scripts etc to push check results without needing to know anything about Sensus internal implementation An excellent client socket use case example is a web application pushing check results to indicate database connectivity issues To configure the Sensu client socket for a client please refer to the client socket attributes16 HTTP Socket The HTTP socket just like the TCP and UDP sockets accepts check results but it requires a wellformed HTTP request and exposes other functionality that is not possible with the raw TCPUDP sockets In exchange for a bit more complexity the HTTP socket interface has the advantage of being more expressive than a raw TCPUDP socket both in the requests that it accepts and how it responds and so exposes more functionality The following endpoints are available for the HTTP socket GET info This endpoint returns 200 OK with some basic Sensu information like the version and transport metrics POST results This endpoint expects an applicationjson body with a check result GET settings This endpoint responds with 200 OK and the sensu configuration Due to the possible sensitive nature of the client settings eg passwords might be in the config this endpoint is protected using HTTP basic authentication and by default the information returned is redacted eg common config keys like password have their values replaced by REDACTED See the redact configuration option if you need control over what is redacted This endpoint accepts the optional query string redactedfalse to disable redaction Refer to the http client socket attributes50 for details on configuring the HTTP basic authentication details that this endpoint requires GET brew This endpoint gets you some fresh coffee Try it Any requests for unknown endpoints will get a 404 with some help information in the body At the moment only unsecure HTTP no HTTPS is supported To configure the Sensu HTTP client socket please refer to the http client socket attributes50 Example client socket usage The following is an example demonstrating external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket The example uses Bashs builtin devtcp file to communicate with the Sensu client socket echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 devtcplocalhost3030 Netcat17 can also be used instead of the TCP file echo name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 You can do the same using the HTTP socket curl v H ContentType applicationjson X POST d name app01 output could not connect to mysql status 1 localhost 3031 Creating a dead mans switch The Sensu client sockets in combination with check TTLs can be used to create whats commonly referred to as dead mans switches Outside of the software industry a dead mans switch is a switch that is automatically triggered if a human operator becomes incapacitated source Wikipedia18 Sensu is more interested in detecting silent failures than incapacited human operators By using Check TTLs Sensu is able to set an expectation that a Sensu client will continue to publish results for a check at a regular interval If a Sensu client fails to publish a check result and the check TTL expires Sensu will create an event to indicate the silent failure For more information on check TTLs please refer to the check attributes reference documentation14 A great use case for the Sensu client socket is to create a dead mans switch for backup scripts to ensure they continue to run successfully at regular intervals If an external source sends a Sensu check result with a check TTL to the Sensu client socket Sensu will expect another check result from the same external source before the TTL expires The following is an example of external check result input via the Sensu client TCP socket using a check TTL to create a dead mans switch for MySQL backups The example uses a check TTL of 25200 seconds or 7 hours A MySQL backup script using the following code would be expected to continue to send a check result at least once every 7 hours or Sensu will create an event7 to indicate the silent failure echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output backed up mysql successfully sizemb568 status 0 nc localhost 3030 echo name backupmysql ttl 25200 output failed to backup mysql status 1 nc localhost 3030 Standalone check execution scheduler In addition to subscribing to client subscriptions3 and executing check requests published by the Sensu server19 the Sensu client is able to maintain its ownseparate schedule for standalone checks20 Because the Sensu client shares the same check scheduling algorithm21 as the Sensu server it is not only possible to have consistency between subscription checks22 and standalone checks mdash its also possible to maintain consistency between standalone checks across an entire infrastructure assuming that system clocks are synchronized via NTP23 Client configuration Example client definition The following is an example Sensu client definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdclientjson This client definition provides Sensu with information about the system on which it resides This is a production system running a web server and a MySQL database The client name attribute is required in the definition and must be unique client name i424242 address 8888 subscriptions production webserver mysql socket bind 127001 port 3030 Client definition specification The client definition uses the client configuration scope24 client attributes name "},{"title":"Sensu

type of Hash merging is often called deep merging and is probably the most important concept to understand when learning how to configure Sensu Configuration load order As previously mentioned Sensu configuration can be provided via three distinct sources environment variables a configuration file and one or more directories containing configuration files Sensu loads configuration from these sources in the following order 1 The Sensu service scripts provide command line arguments1 for starting the Sensu services eg the location of the configuration file c the location of configuration directories d etc 2 Sensu will load configuration from environment variables2 3 Sensu loads configuration from the configuration file by default this is located at etcsensuconfigjson 3 Sensu loads configuration snippets from configuration files located in a Sensu configuration directory by default this is etcsensuconfd however it is possible to configure Sensu to load from multiple configuration directories see command line arguments1 below NOTE configuration file load order is dictated by a json glob of the configuration directory as such it is strongly recommended to avoid a dependency on configuration directory file load order eg if youre attempting to name configuration files in the configuration directory to control load order youre doing it wrong Configuration merging configurationmerging To explain how Sensu merges configuration parameters from the various disparate configuration sources please note the following example scenario 1 The Sensu runtime configuration is stored as an inmemory Hash object For the purposes of providing a visual example lets imagine that this Hash object is actually a JSON document which begins life as Sensu is started as an empty JSON document Initial Sensu configuration Hash in memory When Sensu is started it will begin to collect configuration from environment variables a configuration file and one ore more configuration directories which configuration parameters will be used to build up this configuration Hash 2 For the purposes of this example lets assume that the first configuration snippet that Sensu encounters is a configuration file located at etcsensuconfigjson with the following contents New config file on disk at etcsensuconfigjson rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host 100120 port 6379 password secret At this time the Sensu configuration Hash in memory will look like Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host localhost vhost sensu user sensu password secret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret 3 Now lets see what happens when Sensu encounters another configuration snippet eg a file located in a Sensu configuration directory such as etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson New config file contents on disk at etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson rabbitmq host 100110 user sensu01 password newsecret The second configuration snippet provided configuration for the rabbitmq scope some of which already exists in the Sensu configuration Hash in memory but also missing some attributes which already exist in the Sensu configuration Hash ie vhost The result of merging this configuration snippet into the Sensu configuration Hash in memory is as follows Updated Sensu configuration Hash in memory rabbitmq host 100110 vhost sensu user sensu01 password newsecret redis host localhost port 6379 password secret The result of the deep merge is that the configuration snippet provided by etcsensuconfdrabbitmqjson was overlaid on the Sensu configuration Hash in memory essentially overwriting the previously existing values provided by the configuration snippet while not discarding configuration attributes that already existed in the rabbitmq configuration scope even though they werent provided by the configuration snippet Configuration logging As configuration snippets are applied to the Sensu configuration Hash ie during deep merge all configuration changes are logged to the corresponding log file eg the Sensu server API or Client logs Configuration scopes Because Sensu configuration can be provided in so many different sources it is important to understand that ndash regardless of the physical location of the configuration data eg from the main configuration file or from a configuration file in a configuration directory ndash all configuration must be placed in the appropriate scope in the JSON file ie the named level that attributes should be defined in For example the root or scope of the Sensu configuration would be any attributes defined at the top level of a JSON configuration file such as the configuration attributes for rabbitmq redis or the api rabbitmq redis api Attributes defined in the root scope or top level provide the corresponding scopes for additional configuration settings eg the rabbitmq attribute defined above provides the rabbitmq scope a JSON Hash for the actual RabbitMQ configuration settings Configuration scopes are relative Throughout the Sensu documentation whenever a configuration scope is mentioned it is describing the named level that the corresponding configuration attributes should be defined within which may be relative to any potentially related scopes Please note the following examples Configuration scope examples The client scope client In the Sensu Client reference documentation3 it explains that The client definition uses the client definition scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu client configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client client The client socket scope socket The Sensu Client reference documentation3 continues to explain that Sensu clients may have a socket attribute and that there are additional Client Socket attributes4 which should be defined within the socket scope The following attributes are configured within the socket client definition attribute scope Which means that regardless where you might store a configuration file containing Sensu Client Socket configuration on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu the file should contain a top level attribute called client and another attribute defined within the client scope or level called socket client socket Thus when the Client Socket reference documentation continues to explain that the bind and port attributes should be defined in the Client Socket scope it means they should live under the socket level of the JSON file regardless of where you might store a configuration file containing said configuration attributes on disk assuming it is in a location that will be loaded by Sensu client socket bind 0000 port 3031 Sensu service service configuration sensuservicescriptconfiguration The Sensu services are managed by service scripts that are provided in the Sensu packages The Sensu service scripts are able to startstoprestart the corresponding Sensu services eg the Sensu server API client etc The default Sensu service scripts and related configuration files containing

gemthesensuextensiongem The Sensu Extensions gem templatethesensuextensionsgemtemplate What is a Sensu extension Unlike Sensu plugins which spawn a new child process at every execution Sensu extensions execute directly inside the EventMachine reactor thread1 of a Sensu client or server process Because they avoid the overhead of spawning a new process at every invocation Sensu extensions can fulfill the same functions as plugins acting as checks filters mutators or handlers but with much greater efficiency WARNING While their performance characteristics are quite desirable Sensu extensions come with major caveats extensions have full access to Sensus internals and any extension which blocks the EventMachine reactor for any period of time eg blocking on disk IO or network request will have a very significant negative impact on Sensus performance and functionality The details of evented programming as implemented by EventMachine are outside the scope of this document but Javier Acero has helpfully written on the implications of blocking the reactor2 Installing Sensu extensions As of version 026 Sensu supports loading extensions from properly packaged gems This approach takes advantage of the existing RubyGems infrastructure and tools to make publishing and installing Sensu extensions easy Use sensuinstall to install Sensu Extensions The Sensu Core package

extensions Sensu extensions which are not properly packaged as gems are considered legacy meaning they predate the new specification for loading Sensu Extensions from gems These legacy extensions are loaded from the directory specified by the extensiondir flag provided when Sensu processes are started8 On most systems this defaults to etcsensuextensions as specified by the command flags passed to the sensuclient or sensuserver process via the service supervision scheme in use eg init runit upstart systemd etc Extensions should be installed directly into the extensions directory When an legacy extension has dependencies on thirdparty Ruby gems or other external applications those dependencies must be installed into the Sensu embedded Ruby environment as well Configuring Sensu Extensions The configurability of Sensu extensions is entirely a function of the extension code For example filters and mutators cannot be applied to an extension via a standard handler definition Instead these aspects of the extensions configuration must be defined in code by overriding the SensuExtensionBase definition method10 EXAMPLE extensionconfigurationincodeexample def definition type extension name name filters occurrences mutator onlycheckoutput end The above code would configure the associated extension to apply the occurrences filter and then the onlycheckoutput mutator prior to executing the extensions custom run method By virtue of being loaded into the Sensu client or server process Sensu extensions have access to the running Sensu configuration As such an extension can make use of any available configuration scopes9 but the prevailing convention is for extensions to use unique toplevel configuration scopes The systemprofile4 extension installed in a previous example looks to the toplevel systemprofile configuration scope The following configuration added to etcsensuconfd would change the systemprofile extensions Graphite path prefix from a default value of system to profile EXAMPLE providingextensionconfigurationexample systemprofile pathprefix profile The sensuextension gem Unlike Sensu plugins which may be written in any programming language Sensu extensions must be written in Ruby The sensuextension5 gem provides SensuExtensionBase and other classes which Sensu extensions should subclass The sensuextensions gem template The sensuextensions gem template12 provides a starting point for those who wish to author their own Sensu extension as a Ruby gem It is recommended that your gem follow the naming pattern sensuextensionNAME in order to ensure it can be easily installed with sensuinstall NOTE if you choose not to use this template for your extension note the directory structure it demonstrates eg placing extension code under libsensuextensions are required to ensure the extension is properly loaded Example extensions For simple examples of Sensu extensions consider the onlycheckoutput mutator6 or the debug handler7 both of which ship with Sensu

attributeswhenattributes What are Sensu filters Sensu Filters also called Event Filters allow you to filter events destined for one or more event Handlers1 Sensu filters inspect event data and match its keysvalues with filter definition attributes to determine if the event should be passed to an event handler Filters are commonly used to filter recurring events ie to eliminate notification noise and to filter events from systems in preproduction environments When to use a filter Sensu Filters allow you to configure conditional logic to be applied during the event processing flow Compared to executing an event handler evaluating event filters is an inexpensive operation which can provide overall monitoring performance gains by reducing the number of events that need to be handled Additionally by using Sensu Filters instead of building conditional logic into custom Handlers conditional logic can be applied to multiple Handlers and monitoring configuration stays DRY How do Sensu filters work Sensu Filters are applied when Event Handlers1 are configured to use one or more Filters Prior to executing a Handler the Sensu server will apply any Filters configured for the Handler to the Event Data If the Event is not removed by the Filters ie filtered out the Handler will be executed The filter analysis flow performs these steps When the Sensu server is processing an Event it will check for the definition of a handler or handlers Prior to executing each Handler the Sensu server will first apply any configured filter or filters for the Handler If multiple filters are configured for a Handler they are executed sequentially Filter attributes are compared with Event data Filters can be inclusive only matching events are handled or exclusive matching events are not handled As soon as a Filter removes an Event ie filters it out no further analysis is performed and the Event Handler will not be executed NOTE Filters specified in a handler set16 definition have no effect Filters must be specified in individual handler definitions Inclusive and Exclusive Filtering Filters can be inclusive negate false or exclusive negate true Configuring a handler to use multiple inclusive filters is the equivalent of using an AND query operator ie only handle events if they match inclusive filters x AND y AND z Configuring a handler to use multiple exclusive filters is the equivalent of using an OR operator ie only handle events if they dont match x OR y OR z Inclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate false only events that match the defined filter attributes are handled Exclusive filtering by setting the filter definition attribute2 negate true events are only handled if they do not match the defined filter attributes NOTE unless otherwise configured in the filter definition2 the default filtering behavior is inclusive filtering ie negate false Filter attribute comparison Filter attributes are compared directly with their event data3 counterparts For inclusive filter definitions4 ie negate false matching attributes will result in the filter returning a true value for exclusive filter definitions4 ie negate true matching attributes will result in the filter returning a false value ie the event does not pass through the filter Filters that return a true value will continue to be processed mdash via additional filters if defined mutators if defined and handlers EXAMPLE The following example filter definition entitled productionfilter will match event data3 with a custom client definition attribute5 environment production filters productionfilter negate false attributes client environment production Filter attribute evaluation When more complex conditional logic is needed than direct filter attribute comparison10 Sensu filters provide support for attribute evaluation using Ruby expressions When a Filter attribute value is a string beginning with eval the remainder is evaluated as a Ruby expression The Ruby expression is evaluated in a sandbox and provided a single variable value which is equal to the event data attribute value being compared If the evaluated expression returns true the attribute is a match Example Handling state change only Some teams migrating to Sensu have asked about reproducing the behavior of their old monitoring system which alerts only on state change This statechangeonly inclusive4 filter provides such filters statechangeonly negate false attributes occurrences eval value 1 action resolve This eval filter is effective because value of event occurrences is reset on each state change except when the event action is resolve The resolve action is set on an event when its check result status is 0 following one or more prior nonzero statuses Example Handling repeated events The following example filter definition entitled filterinterval60hourly will match event data3 with a check interval6 of 60 seconds and an occurrences value of 1 ie the first occurrence OR any occurrences value that is evenly divisible by 60 via a modulo operator7 calculation ie calculating the remainder after dividing occurrences by 60 Note that negate is true making this an exclusive filter4 if evaluation returns false the event will be handled filters filterinterval60hourly negate true attributes check interval 60 occurrences eval value 1 value 60 0 The next example will apply the same logic as the previous example but for checks with a 30 second interval filters filterinterval30hourly negate true attributes check interval 30 occurrences eval value 1 value 120 0 NOTE The effect of both of these filters is that they will only allow an events with 30second or 60second intervals to be handled1 on the first occurrence of the event and again every hour Previous examples in the older Sensu docs have not included the check interval 60 attribute which has confused some users because filtering based on occurrences alone assumes some understanding of the relationship between occurrences and interval which isnt always obvious Example Handling events during office hours only This filter evaluates the event timestamp to determine if the event occurred between 9 AM and 5 PM on a weekday Remember that negate defaults to false so this is an inclusive filter If evaluation returns false the event will not be filters ninetofiver negate false attributes timestamp eval 12345includeTimeatvaluewday Timeatvaluehourbetween917 Filter attribute eval tokens What are filter attribute eval tokens Sensu filters attributes may be evaluated using Ruby expressions10 which evaluations provide support for comparing a single event attribute variable against a basic logical statement eg is value greater than 60 When additional variables are needed beyond the single value variable provided by eval tokens may be used Eval tokens are filter attribute placeholders that can be replaced by Sensu check definition attributes6 and client definition attributes8 including custom attributes Example filter attribute eval token The following is an example Sensu filter definition2 which is using a token checkoccurrences60 as a secondary attribute in the Ruby eval expression The token will be replaced by the check definition attribute6 named occurrences if it is defined otherwise it will use the fallback value of 60 filters occurrences negate true attributes occurrences eval value checkoccurrences60 This example would be useful for filtering events that dont exceed a minimum number of occurrences as configured in the check definition Filter attribute eval token specification Eval token substitution syntax Eval tokens are invoked by wrapping event data attributes with triple colons ie three colon characters before and after the attribute ie Nested event data attributes3 may be accessed via dot notation eg checkoccurrences occurrences would be replaced with the event occurrences data11 checkmythreshold would be replaced with a custom check definition attribute12 called mythreshold Eval token default values Eval token default values can be used as a fallback in the event that an eval token attribute13 is not satisfied by event data3 Eval token default values are separated by a pipe character and can be used to provide a fallback value for events that are missing the declared token attribute checkoccurrences60 would be replaced with a check definition attribute6 called occurrences If occurrences is not defined in the check definition the default or fallback value of 60 will be used NOTE if an eval token default value is not provided ie as a fallback value and the event data does not contain a matching eval token attribute13 an log entry indicating an error called filter eval unmatched tokens will be published to the Sensu server log Filter configuration Example filter definition examplefilterdefinition The following is an example Sensu filter definition a JSON configuration file located at etcsensuconfdfilterproductionjson This is an inclusive filter definition called production The effect of this filter is that only events with the custom client attribute5 environment production will

email alert creating or resolving an incident eg in PagerDuty ServiceNow etc or storing metrics in a timeseries database eg Graphite Handler types There are several types of handlers The most common handler type is the pipe handler which works very similarly to how checks3 work enabling Sensu to interact with almost any computer program via standard streams4 Pipe handlers Pipe handlers pipe event data into arbitrary commands via STDIN TCPUDP handlers TCP and UDP handlers send event data to a remote socket eg external API Transport handlers Transport handlers publish event data to the Sensu transport5 Handler sets Handler sets also called set handlers are used to group event handlers making it easy to manage groups of actions that should be executed for certain types of events The default handler Sensu expects all events2 to have a corresponding handler Event handlers may be configured in check definitions16 however if no handler or handlers have been configured Sensu will attempt to handle the event using a handler named15 default The default handler is only a reference ie Sensu does not provide a builtin default handler so if no handler definition exists for a handler named default Sensu will log an error indicating that the event was not handled because a default handler definition does not exist To use one or more existing handlers as the default you can create a Set handler17 called default and include the existing handlers in the set Pipe handlers Pipe handlers are external commands that can consume event data6 via STDIN Example pipe handler definition

What is the Sensu server The Sensu server schedules and publishes check execution requests1 to client subscriptions2 via a PublishSubscribe model3 and provides a scalable event processing platform4 for processing check results and monitoring events Sensu Core vs Sensu Enterprise The Sensu server comes in two flavors the opensource Sensu Core5 via the sensuserver process and Sensu Enterprise6 via the sensuenterprise process To learn more about the differences between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise please visit the Sensu website7 NOTE Sensu Enterprise ie the sensuenterprise process was designed to be a dropin replacement for the Sensu Core server and API ie the sensuserver and sensuapi As such any mention of the Sensu server in the Sensu documentation also applies to the sensuenterprise process for Sensu Enterprise users WARNING as noted above the sensuenterprise process is designed to replace both of the Sensu Core sensuserver and sensuapi processes Because Sensu Enterprise will load the same configuration as Sensu Core it is important that the Sensu Core processes are stopped before starting Sensu Enterprise to avoid known conflicts and processing errors such as attempting to bind on the same ports etc Check execution scheduling Check execution scheduling is performed by a Sensu server see Sensu server task election8 Checks are scheduled by querying Sensus configuration for defined checks ndash excluding check with the attributes standalone true or publish false ndash and calculating when executions should occur based on their defined intervals Check scheduling algorithm synchronization checkschedulingalgorithmsynchronization Sensu uses an internal algorithm for determining a unique cadence for Sensu checks which uniqueness is based on the check name and interval This algorithm outputs a value in milliseconds which the Sensu server will use as an offset before the next check request should be published In practice this means that ndash assuming system clocks are in sync between disparate Sensu servers ndash check requests for a given check based on the check name will be published at the exact same time The also means that in the event of a Sensu server restart andor Sensu server task reelection ie if a new Sensu server is elected to become reponsible for check execution scheduling check execution scheduling intervals will remain consistent In fact because this algorithm is also shared by the Sensu client ndash which provides decentralized check execution scheduling in the form of standalone checks22 ndash a check defined on the Sensu server and a matching standalone check defined on a Sensu client should also stay in sync with each other again assuming that system clocks are in sync and the check names and intervals are consistent Event processing The Sensu server provides a scalable event processor Event processing involves conversion of check results9 into Sensu events and then applying any defined event filters10 event data mutators11 and event handlers12 All event processing happens on a Sensu server system The event processing workflow happens in the following order Event Filter Mutator Handler NOTE events that are filtered out ie removed by Sensu event filtersfilters will not continue to be mutated by event data mutatorsmutators or event handlershandlers Sensus event processing capabilities can be distributed among multiple Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster For more information on configuring a Sensu cluster please see Scaling Sensu13 below Automated task election The Sensu server processes ie sensuserver and sensuenterprise are designed to scale horizontally14 ie by adding systems No additional configuration is required to run a cluster of Sensu servers other than the location of the transport15 and data store16 When Sensu servers start they participate in an election process to automatically distribute tasks A Sensu server may be elected for more than one task A server task can only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart All Sensu servers in a Sensu cluster monitor the state of task execution on a 10second interval automatically electing a new Sensu server for a task if the current one hasnt confirmed execution in more than 30 seconds Server tasks In a Sensu server cluster responsibility for a distinct set of tasks is distributed amongst members of the cluster The tasks only run on one Sensu server at a time and will automatically failover to another Sensu server in the event of a service failure or restart When adding Sensu servers to a cluster restarting the existing Sensu servers in the cluster will force a redistribution of tasks Check request

silencingcomparingstashbasedandnativesilencing Migrating from stashbased silencingmigratingfromstashbasedsilencing What is Sensu Silencing As check results0 are processed by a Sensu server the server executes event handlers1 to send alerts to personnel or otherwise relay event data to external services Although event handlers can be directly configured with filters11 to improve overall signaltonoise ratio there are many scenarios in which operators receiving notifications from Sensu require an ondemand means to suppress alerts Sensus builtin silencing provides the means to suppress execution of event handlers on an adhoc basis By using a dashboard or other tool to interact with the silenced API2 operators can mute notifications onthefly The silenced API manipulates silencing entries in the Sensu data store These entries describe a combination of check name and subscription When the check name3 andor subscription4 described in a silencing entry match an event the handler will not be executed and an informational message will be logged Individual handlers may optout of silencing by configuring the handlesilenced attribute5 NOTE Silencing described in this reference document is implemented in Sensu version 026 or later and Sensu Enterprise 20 or later When to use silencing Silencing is used to prevent handlers from being triggered based on the check name present in a check result or the subscriptions associated with the client that published the check result This can be desirable in many scenarios giving operators the ability to quiet incoming alerts while coordinating their response Sensu silencing entries make it possible to Silence all checks on a specific clientsilenceallchecksonaspecificclient Silence a specific check on a specific

above combinations silencing entries support Expiration after a specified number of seconds Expiration after check returns to OK state resolves Describing the reason or rationale Describing the creator or entity responsible for an entry How does silencing work Silencing entries are created on an adhoc basis via the silenced API2 endpoint When silencing entries are successfully created via the API they are assigned an ID in the format SUBSCRIPTIONCHECK where SUBSCRIPTION is the name of a Sensu client subscription and CHECK is the name of a Sensu check Silencing entries can be used to silence checks on specific clients by by taking advantage of perclient subscriptions4 added in Sensu 026 eg clientCLIENTNAME These silencing entries are persisted to the silenced registry in the Sensu data store10 When the Sensu server processes subsequent check results it consults this registry to determine whether or not a matching silencing entry exists If one or more matching entries exist in the registry the event context for the check result is updated to indicate that the event is silenced and the ID of the entries which the check result matched When creating a silencing entry a combination of check and subscription can be specified but only one or the other is strictly required For example when a silencing entry is created specifying only a check its ID will contain an asterisk or wildcard in the SUBSCRIPTION position This indicates that any event with a matching check name will be marked as silenced regardless of the originating clients subscriptions Conversely a silencing entry which specifies only a subscription will have an ID with an asterisk in the CHECK position This indicates that any event where the originating clients subscriptions match the subscription specified in the entry will be marked as silenced regardless of the check name NOTE Starting with version 026 Sensu clients automatically add a subscription containing their client name prefixed with the string client For example client i424242 will automatically add subscription clienti424242 Silencing checks at the individual client level requires clients to run Sensu 026 or be manually configured with a client subscription Silencing entry specification Silencing entries are composed as a JSON document containing at least one of the required subscription or check attributes and additional optional attributes as desired Silencing entries are created updated and deleted by submitting JSON documents to endpoints on the silenced API2 via HTTP POST as shown in the examples

3000 Sensu dashboard not yet complete 8080 Sensu API all users need access to this port 8081 Agent API all agents need access to this port We suggest but do not require persistent storage for sensuagents The Sensu Agent will cache runtime assets locally for each check This storage should be unique per sensuagent process How To 1 Start the sensubackend process docker run v

checks are commands executed by the Sensu agent which monitor a condition eg is Nginx running or collect measurements eg how much disk space do I have left Although the Sensu agent will attempt to execute any command defined for a check successful processing of check results requires adherence to a simple specification Specification Result data is output to STDOUT or STDERR For standard checks this output is typically a humanreadable message For metrics checks this output contains the measurements gathered by the check Exit status code indicates state 0 indicates OK 1 indicates WARNING 2 indicates CRITICAL exit status codes other than 0 1 or 2 indicate an UNKNOWN or custom status Viewing To view all the checks that are currently configured for the cluster enter sensuctl check list If

checkdisk SCHEDULING A check can be scheduled according to an interval integer in seconds or a cron string see GoDoc Cronhttpsgodocorggithubcomrobfigcron In the presence of both the cron schedule will take precedence over the interval schedule In addition to traditional CronhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiCron strings Go also accepts many forms of human readable strings for the cron schedule ex midnight daily and every 1h30m Please feel free to use these human readable strings with one caveat If the schedule can be described using either the interval or cron field ex interval 10 or cron every 10s we suggest you default to the interval This is because Sensu splays interval schedules to ensure a distributed load of checks STDIN set this to true when creating a check interactively or by passing stdin to tell the agent to pass the event to your check via STDIN at runtime NOTE Due to Etcd performance limitations see FAQhttpsgithubcomsensusensualphadocumentationblobmaster97FAQmd FAQ and general security features the maximum http request body size is 512K bytes Assets Assets are a way to provide your checks with runtime dependencies they require to execute These can be anything from scripts eg checkhaproxysh to full runtimes ruby python etc Most helpful in environments without a configuration management system where your systems images containers might not have everything required to run a execute a check At runtime the agent sequentially fetches assets and stores them in its local cache On subsequent check executions it checks for the presence of the asset in its cache and ensures that the contents matches its checksum Asset Structure The agent expects that an asset is a TAR archive that may optionally be GZipd Any scripts or executables should be within a bin folder within in the archive Further when the check is executed the following are injected into the execution context PATHTOASSETbin is injected into the PATH environment variable PATHTOASSETlib is injected into the LDLIBRARYPATH environment variable PATHTOASSETinclude is injected into the CPATH environment variable Storage At this time the Sensus backend does not provide any storage capabilities for assets The assets are expected to be retrieved over HTTP or HTTPS Basics To view all assets currently available in your configured Sensu instance Run sensuctl asset list If you want more in depth details on an

specify conditions inwhich your asset should be installed on an agent For example you have a check thats assets have to differ for each platform eg You create an asset name curllinux the filter

incident or outage has an ideal first responder a team or individual with the knowledge to triage and address the issue Sensu Enterprise contact routing makes it possible to assign checks to specific teams andor individuals reducing mean time to response and recovery MTTR Contact routing works with all of the Sensu Enterprise thirdparty notification and metric integrations How does contact routing work Sensu Enterprise contacts are defined in JSON configuration files which we recommend to store in the etcsensuconfdcontacts directory A contact is composed of a name and configuration overrides for one or more of Sensu Enterprises builtin integrations A contact in Sensu Enterprise is not too dissimilar from a contact on your phone which usually have a name and one or more identifiers for various communication channels eg a phone number email address Twitter username etc The following example contact definition provides overrides for the Sensu Enterprise email and Slack integration default configuration settings contacts support email to supportsensuappcom slack channel support Once defined Sensu Enterprise contacts are used the same way in which you use contacts on your phone ndash by selecting a communication channel eg phone call SMS email etc ndash and then selecting the contact With Sensu Enterprise contact routing the communication channels are builtin handlers integrations1 and the selection of which channel to use is managed by a check definition or client definition The following example check definition will use the builtin Sensu Enterprise email integration event handler notifying the support contact for any corresponding events checks examplecheck command dosomethingrb interval 30 handler email contact support Contact routing configuration

integrations3 and more Sensu Enterprise also includes FREE annual training4 and enterpriseclass support5 We like to think of the distinction between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise as the difference between a framework and a product The purpose of this documentation is to help Sensu Enterprise users configure their installation making use of the many thirdparty integrations and features Sensu Enterprise has to offer Sensu Enterprise integrates with thirdparty tools services to provide support for creatingresolving incidents oncall rotation scheduling storing time series data metrics relaying events deregistering sensuclients for terminated nodes andor notifying contacts via various media Upgrading to Sensu Enterprise Sensu Enterprise is designed to be a dropin replacement for the

Enterprise contacts are defined in JSON configuration files which we recommend to store in the etcsensuconfdcontacts directory A contact is composed of a name and configuration overrides for one or more of Sensu Enterprises builtin integrations A contact in Sensu Enterprise is not too dissimilar from a contact on your phone which usually have a name and one or more identifiers for various communication channels eg a phone number email address Twitter username etc The following example contact definition provides overrides for the Sensu Enterprise email and Slack integration default configuration settings contacts support email to supportsensuappcom slack channel support Once defined Sensu Enterprise contacts are used the same way in which you use contacts on your phone ndash by selecting a communication channel eg phone call SMS email etc ndash and then selecting the contact With Sensu Enterprise contact routing the communication channels are builtin handlers integrations1 and the selection of which channel to use is managed by a check definition or client definition The following example check definition will use the builtin Sensu Enterprise email integration event

individuals reducing mean time to response and recovery MTTR Contact routing works with all of the Sensu Enterprise thirdparty notification and metric integrations How does contact routing work Sensu Enterprise contacts are defined in JSON configuration files which we recommend to store in the etcsensuconfdcontacts directory A contact is composed of a name and configuration overrides for one or more of Sensu Enterprises builtin integrations A contact in Sensu Enterprise is not too dissimilar from a contact on your phone which usually have a name and one or more identifiers for various communication channels eg a phone number email address Twitter username etc The following example contact definition provides overrides for the Sensu Enterprise email and Slack integration default configuration settings contacts support email to supportsensuappcom slack channel support Once defined Sensu Enterprise contacts are used the same way in which you use contacts on your phone ndash by selecting a communication channel eg phone call SMS email etc ndash and then selecting the contact With Sensu Enterprise contact routing the communication channels are builtin handlers integrations1 and the selection of which channel to use is managed by a check definition or client definition The following example check definition will use the builtin Sensu Enterprise email integration event handler notifying the support contact for any corresponding events checks examplecheck command dosomethingrb interval 30 handler email contact support Contact routing configuration Example contact

is the Sensu Enterprise Dashboardwhatisthesensuenterprisedashboard What is Uchiwawhatisuchiwa What is the Sensu Enterprise Consolewhatisthesensuenterpriseconsole What is a Sensu datacenterwhatisasensudatacenter What is the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is a simple webbased application that provides realtime visibility into Sensu monitoring data with dedicated views for monitoring events clients checks aggregates data centers and more The dashboard provides powerful global search features for filtering views so users can focus on the data thats important to them The dashboard also provides basic operational controls to acknowledge or otherwise silence monitoring events request ad hoc execution of monitoring checks and much more What is Uchiwa The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is based on the opensource ndash and community developed ndash Uchiwa2 dashboard Very much like the relationship between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard builds on top of Uchiwa via a number of addedvalue extensions eg Role Based Access Controls3 LDAP4 GitHub5 and GitLab6 authentication Audit Logging7 etc which development also results in many contributions to the opensource Uchiwa dashboard project What is the Sensu Enterprise Console The Sensu Enterprise Console is a federated API endpoint provided by the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard for API access to multiple Sensu datacenters1 available in Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 and newer This API provides addedvalue features including tokenbased authentication and granular rolebased access controls16 NOTE the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is comprised of two components a backend service API for aggregating monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters5 and a web application for displaying this information As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 this Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend has been updated so that it provides the same API endpoints as the Sensu API1 Prior to version 110 the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend used different API routes for accessing data from specific datacenters for example client data was accessible via clientsuswest1client instead of clientsclientdcuswest1 Version 111 introduced access tokenbased authentication and version 112 introduced RBAC for the Console API What is a Sensu datacenter The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard provides access to monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters A Sensu datacenter is simply a Sensu API endpoint which corresponds to a Sensu installation consisting of one or more Sensu servers in cluster multiple API endpoints may be provided by a single Sensu installation or cluster 1 whatisasensudatacenter 2 httpwwwuchiwaio 3 sensuenterprisedashboard210rbacoverview 4

match a value such as dcuswest1 subscriberrabbitmq subscriptionlinux teamwebops Regular Expressions The match method of Javascripts String object is used to retrieve the matches thus the following special characters are available to use exclusively in the values of a query Matches any single character For example dcastria matches the datacenter austria Matches the preceding character 0 or more times For example dccan matches the datacenters canada and vatican but not cameroon Matches the preceding character 1 or more times For example dcira matches the datacenters iran and iraq but not ireland Matches the preceding character 0 or 1 time For example dcoco matches the datacenter cameroon but not morocco Matches beginning of input For example dcpor matches the datacenter portugal but not singapore Matches end of input For example dcnea matches the datacenter guinea but not guineabissau Operators The familiar operators AND OR and NOT are supported You may use multiple operators within a single query Be aware that the use of many operators may cause higher than normal resource usage dcuseast1 AND namecentos Includes all items from the datacenter useast1 that have centos in

Uchiwa2 dashboard Very much like the relationship between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard builds on top of Uchiwa via a number of addedvalue extensions eg Role Based Access Controls3 LDAP4 GitHub5 and GitLab6 authentication Audit Logging7 etc which development also results in many contributions to the opensource Uchiwa dashboard project What is the Sensu Enterprise Console The Sensu Enterprise Console is a federated API endpoint provided by the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard for API access to multiple Sensu datacenters1 available in Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 and newer This API provides addedvalue features including tokenbased authentication and granular rolebased access controls16 NOTE the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is comprised of two components a backend service API for aggregating monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters5 and a web application for displaying this information As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 this Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend has been updated so that it provides the same API endpoints as the Sensu API1 Prior to version 110 the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend used different API routes for accessing data from specific datacenters for example client data was accessible via clientsuswest1client instead of clientsclientdcuswest1 Version 111 introduced access tokenbased authentication and version 112 introduced RBAC for the Console API What is a Sensu datacenter whatisasensudatacenter The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard provides access to monitoring data from one or more

limited access to Sensu data they will only see history graphs and status widgets corresponding to the Sensu Subscriptions andor Datacenters they have access to NOTE At this time history graph data is stored in local storage via the browser which means that history graph data will only be available for as long as the user has the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard open An upcoming release of Sensu Enterprise will be providing this data via a new metrics API at which point history graph data will not be stored in the browser and a full 8hours of history will be available at all times Features History Graphs The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard HUD includes two history graphs which provide ataglance visibility for up to 8hours of monitoring system history captured in 10second intervals Event History Graph The Event History Graph records the state of Sensu events every 10 seconds The graph will display the total count of critical red warning yellow silenced gray and unknown black events The Event History Graph retains the last 8hours of event history Client History Graph The Client History Graph records the state of Sensu clients every 10 seconds The graph will display the total count of critical red warning yellow silenced gray and healthy green clients The Client History Graph retains the last 8hours of client history Status Summary Widgets The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard HUD includes three columns of status widgets which provide ataglance visibility into the status of Sensu Checks Events and Datacenters Each column will only display widgets corresponding to the current state of the monitoring system eg if there are no Critical events the Critical event count widget will not be displayed Check Status Summary Widgets The Check Status Summary widgets provide

a simple webbased application that provides realtime visibility into Sensu monitoring data with dedicated views for monitoring events clients checks aggregates data centers and more The dashboard provides powerful global search features for filtering views so users can focus on the data thats important to them The dashboard also provides basic operational controls to acknowledge or otherwise silence monitoring events request ad hoc execution of monitoring checks and much more What is Uchiwa The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is based on the opensource ndash and community developed ndash Uchiwa2 dashboard Very much like the relationship between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard builds on top of Uchiwa via a number of addedvalue extensions eg Role Based Access Controls3 LDAP4 GitHub5 and GitLab6 authentication Audit Logging7 etc which development also results in many contributions to the opensource Uchiwa dashboard project What is the Sensu Enterprise Console The Sensu Enterprise Console is a federated API endpoint provided by the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard for API access to multiple Sensu datacenters1 available in Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 and newer This API provides addedvalue features including tokenbased authentication and granular rolebased access controls16 NOTE the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is comprised of two components a backend service API for aggregating monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters5 and a web application for displaying this information As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 this Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend has been updated so that it provides the same API endpoints as the Sensu API1 Prior to version 110 the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend used different API routes for accessing data from specific datacenters for example client data was accessible via clientsuswest1client instead of clientsclientdcuswest1 Version 111 introduced access tokenbased authentication and version 112 introduced RBAC for the Console API What is a Sensu datacenter The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard provides access to monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters A Sensu datacenter is simply a Sensu API endpoint which corresponds to a Sensu installation consisting of one or more Sensu servers in cluster multiple API endpoints may be provided by a single Sensu installation or cluster Dashboard configuration Example dashboard configuration The following is the bare minimum that should be included in your Sensu Enterprise Dashboard configuration sensu name

Consolewhatisthesensuenterpriseconsole What is a Sensu datacenterwhatisasensudatacenter What is the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is a simple webbased application that provides realtime visibility into Sensu monitoring data with dedicated views for monitoring events clients checks aggregates data centers and more The dashboard provides powerful global search features for filtering views so users can focus on the data thats important to them The dashboard also provides basic operational controls to acknowledge or otherwise silence monitoring events request ad hoc execution of monitoring checks and much more What is Uchiwa The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is based on the opensource ndash and community developed ndash Uchiwa2 dashboard Very much like the relationship between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard builds on top of Uchiwa via a number of addedvalue extensions eg Role Based Access Controls3 LDAP4 GitHub5 and GitLab6 authentication Audit Logging7 etc which development also results in many contributions to the opensource Uchiwa dashboard project What is the Sensu Enterprise Console The Sensu Enterprise Console is a federated API endpoint provided by the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard for API access to multiple Sensu datacenters1 available in Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 and newer This API provides addedvalue features including tokenbased authentication and granular rolebased access controls16 NOTE the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is comprised of two components a backend service API for aggregating monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters5 and a web application for displaying this information As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 this Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend has been updated so that it provides the same API endpoints as the Sensu API1 Prior to version 110 the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend used different API routes for accessing data from specific datacenters for example client data was accessible via clientsuswest1client instead of clientsclientdcuswest1 Version 111 introduced access tokenbased authentication and version 112 introduced RBAC for the Console API What is a Sensu datacenter The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard provides access to monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters A Sensu datacenter is simply a Sensu API endpoint which corresponds to a Sensu installation consisting of one or more Sensu servers in cluster multiple API endpoints may be provided by a single Sensu installation or cluster 1

subscriptionlinux teamwebops Regular Expressions The match method of Javascripts String object is used to retrieve the matches thus the following special characters are available to use exclusively in the values of a query Matches any single character For example dcastria matches the datacenter austria Matches the preceding character 0 or more times For example dccan matches the datacenters canada and vatican but not cameroon Matches the preceding character 1 or more times For example dcira matches the datacenters iran and iraq but not ireland Matches the preceding character 0 or 1 time For example dcoco matches the datacenter cameroon but not morocco Matches beginning of input For example dcpor matches the datacenter portugal but not singapore Matches end of input For example dcnea matches the datacenter guinea but not guineabissau Operators The familiar operators AND OR and NOT are supported You may use multiple operators within a single query Be aware that the use of many operators may cause higher than normal resource usage dcuseast1 AND namecentos Includes all items from the datacenter useast1 that have centos in their name dcuseast1 OR dcuswest1 Includes all items

a simple webbased application that provides realtime visibility into Sensu monitoring data with dedicated views for monitoring events clients checks aggregates data centers and more The dashboard provides powerful global search features for filtering views so users can focus on the data thats important to them The dashboard also provides basic operational controls to acknowledge or otherwise silence monitoring events request ad hoc execution of monitoring checks and much more What is Uchiwa The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is based on the opensource ndash and community developed ndash Uchiwa2 dashboard Very much like the relationship between Sensu Core and Sensu Enterprise the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard builds on top of Uchiwa via a number of addedvalue extensions eg Role Based Access Controls3 LDAP4 GitHub5 and GitLab6 authentication Audit Logging7 etc which development also results in many contributions to the opensource Uchiwa dashboard project What is the Sensu Enterprise Console The Sensu Enterprise Console is a federated API endpoint provided by the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard for API access to multiple Sensu datacenters1 available in Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 and newer This API provides addedvalue features including tokenbased authentication and granular rolebased access controls16 NOTE the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard is comprised of two components a backend service API for aggregating monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters5 and a web application for displaying this information As of Sensu Enterprise Dashboard version 110 this Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend has been updated so that it provides the same API endpoints as the Sensu API1 Prior to version 110 the Sensu Enterprise Dashboard backend used different API routes for accessing data from specific datacenters for example client data was accessible via clientsuswest1client instead of clientsclientdcuswest1 Version 111 introduced access tokenbased authentication and version 112 introduced RBAC for the Console API What is a Sensu datacenter The Sensu Enterprise Dashboard provides access to monitoring data from one or more Sensu datacenters A Sensu datacenter is simply a Sensu API endpoint which corresponds to a Sensu installation consisting of one or more Sensu servers in cluster multiple API endpoints may be provided by a single Sensu installation or cluster Dashboard configuration Example dashboard configuration The following is the bare minimum that should be included in your Sensu Enterprise Dashboard configuration sensu name
