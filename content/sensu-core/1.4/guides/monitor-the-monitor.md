In this guide, we'll walk you through the best practices and strategies for monitoring Sensu with Sensu. By the end of the guide, you should have a thorough understanding of what is required to ensure your Sensu components are properly monitored, including:

* How to monitor your Sensu server and Sensu API instance(s)
* How to monitor your Uchiwa Dashboard instance(s)
* How to monitor your RabbitMQ instance(s)
* How to monitor your Redis instance(s)

_NOTE: In order to completely monitor a Sensu stack (Sensu services, Redis, RabbitMQ), you will need to have at least one other independent Sensu stack to do so. This is due to a single Sensu stack can not monitor itself completely, as if some components are down, Sensu will not be able to alert on itself properly_

_NOTE: This guide assumes you are not using Sensu clustering, RabbitMQ clustering or using Redis Sentinels. You can still monitor each server using the below described strategies, but it may not be the best way to do so._

## Objectives

We'll cover the following in this guide:

* [Monitoring Sensu](#monitoring-sensu)
  * [Monitoring Sensu Server](#monitoring-sensu-server)
  * [Monitoring Sensu API](#monitoring-sensu-api)
  * [Monitoring Uchiwa](#monitoring-uchiwa-dashboard)
* [Monitoring RabbitMQ](#monitoring-rabbitmq)
* [Monitoring Redis](#monitoring-redis)

## Monitoring Sensu

### Monitoring Sensu Server{#monitoring-sensu-server}

The host running the `sensu-server` service should be monitored in two ways:

* Locally by a `sensu-client` process for Operating System checks/metrics and Sensu services like Uchiwa that are not part of the Sensu event system.
* Remotely from an entirely independent Sensu stack to monitor pieces of the Sensu stack that if down, will make Sensu unable to create events. 

#### Monitoring Sensu Server Locally

Monitoring the host that the `sensu-server` process runs on should be done just like any other node in your infrastructure. This includes, but not limited to, checks and metrics for [CPU][1], [memory][2], [disk][3], and [networking][4]. You can find more plugins at the [Sensu Community Homepage][5].

#### Monitoring Sensu Server Remotely

To monitor the `sensu-server` Server process, you will need to do so from an independent Sensu stack. This can be done by reaching out to Sensu's [API health endpoint][6] and using the [check-http sensu plugin][7] using the following check definition.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_sensu_server_port": {
      "command": "check-http.rb -h remote-api-hostname -P 4567 -p /health?consumers=1 --response-code 204",
      "subscribers": [
        "monitor_remote_sensu_api"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Monitoring Sensu API{#monitoring-sensu-api}

To monitor the `sensu-api` API service, you will need to do so from an independent Sensu stack. This can be done by reach out to the port that the API is listening on using the [check-port sensu plugin][8] using the following check definition.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_sensu_api_port": {
      "command": "check-ports.rb -H remote-sensu-server-hostname -p 4567",
      "subscribers": [
        "monitor_remote_sensu_api"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### Monitoring Uchiwa{#monitoring-uchiwa-dashboard}

*Method 1*

To monitor the Uchiwa Dashboard, you will need to check for two processes named `uchiwa` using [check-process sensu plugin][9] using the following check definition. This check will return a check result with status 2 if less than 2 processes are running with the string `/opt/uchiwa/bin/uchiwa`. We look for two as there is a parent and child process for the `uchiwa service`

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_uchiwa_process": {
      "command": "/opt/sensu/embedded/bin/check-process.rb -p /opt/uchiwa/bin/uchiwa -C 2",
      "subscribers": [
        "monitor_local_uchiwa_processes"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

*Method 2*

You can also monitor the `uchiwa` Dashboard with a remote port check using the [check-port sensu plugin][8] with the following check definition.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_uchiwa_port": {
      "command": "check-ports.rb -H uchiwa-remote-hostname -p 3000",
      "subscribers": [
        "monitor_remote_uchiwa_port"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

_PRO TIP: Use both checks for complete monitoring of your Uchiwa dashboard: catch when both processes are not running and when a firewall port is not open_

## Monitoring RabbitMQ{#monitoring-rabbitmq}

To monitor that your RabbitMQ instance is responding, you will need to do so from an independent Sensu stack. The [rabbitmq-alive sensu plugin][10] provides that ability using the below configuration with your RabbitMQ credentials.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_rabbitmq_alive": {
      "command": "check-rabbitmq-alive.rb -w remote-rabbitmq-host -v remote-rabbitmq-vhost -u remote-rabbitmq-username -p remote-rabbitmq-password -P remote-rabbitmq-listen-port",
      "subscribers": [
        "monitor_remote_rabbitmq"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

While Sensu does not provide benchmarks for a healthy RabbitMQ queue, you can trend the data using the [metrics-rabbitmq-queue sensu plugin][11] metrics check for your instances. In the below check definition, metrics collection is done on the same host as RabbitMQ lives.

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "collect_rabbitmq_queue": {
      "command": "metrics-rabbitmq-queue.rb --host localhost --password :::rabbitmq.password::: --port 15672 --user sensu --filter keepalives",
      "subscribers": [
        "rabbitmq"
      ],
      "interval": 60,
      "type": "metric"
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

then make a check using the [check-rabbitmq-check sensu plugin][12] to then provide an alert when the queue starts to fill up using the following definition

{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "check_rabbitmq_queue": {
      "command": "TODO",
      "subscribers": [
        "rabbitmq"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

## Monitoring Redis{#monitoring-redis}

To monitor that your Redis instance is responding, you will need to do so from an independent Sensu stack. You can use the [check-redis-ping sensu plugin][13].

TODO: test the checks
{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "checks": {
    "redis_ping": {
      "command": "check-redis-ping.rb -h remote.redis.hostname -P redis.password",
      "subscribers": [
        "redis"
      ],
      "interval": 60
    }
  }
}
